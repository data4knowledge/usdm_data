  sectionTitle: Introduction
  text: '<p>The M1 muscarinic-cholinergic receptor is 1 of 5 characterized muscarinic-cholinergic
    receptor subtypes (Fisher and Barak 1994). M1 receptors in the cerebral cortex
    and hippocampus are, for the most part, preserved in Alzheimer''s disease (AD),
    while the presynaptic neurons projecting to these receptors from the nucleus basalis
    of Meynert degenerate (Bierer et al. 1995). The presynaptic loss of cholinergic
    neurons has been correlated to the antimortum cognitive impairment in AD patients,
    prompting speculation that replacement therapy with cholinomimetics will alleviate
    the cognitive dysfunction of the disorder (Fisher and Barak 1994).</p>

    <p>Xanomeline is a novel M1 agonist which has shown high affinity for the M1 receptor
    subtype (in transfected cells), and substantially less or no affinity for other
    muscarinic subtypes. Positron emission tomography (PET) studies of 11C-labeled
    xanomeline in cynomolgus monkeys have suggested that the compound crosses the
    blood-brain barrier and preferentially binds the striatum and neocortex.</p>

    <p>Clinical development of an oral formulation of xanomeline for the indication
    of mild and moderate AD was initiated approximately 4 years ago. A large-scale
    study of safety and efficacy provided evidence that an oral dosing regimen of
    75 mg three times daily (TID) may be associated with enhanced cognition and improved
    clinical global impression, relative to placebo. As well, a dramatic reduction
    in psychosis, agitation, and other problematic behaviors, which often complicate
    the course of the disease, was documented. However, the discontinuation rate associated
    with this oral dosing regimen was 58.6%, and alternative clinical strategies have
    been sought to improve tolerance for the compound.</p>

    <p>To that end, development of a Transdermal Therapeutic System (TTS) has been
    initiated. Relative to the oral formulation, the transdermal formulation eliminates
    high concentrations of xanomeline in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and presystemic
    (firstpass) metabolism. Three transdermal delivery systems, hereafter referred
    to as the xanomeline TTS Formulation A, xanomeline TTS Formulation B, and xanomeline
    TTS formulation E have been manufactured by Lohman Therapy Systems GmbH of Andernach
    Germany. TTS Formulation A is 27 mg xanomeline freebase in a 25-cm2 matrix. TTS
    Formulation B is 57.6 mg xanomeline freebase in a 40-cm2 matrix. Formulation E
    has been produced in 2 patch sizes: 1) 54 mg xanomeline freebase with 0.06 mg
    Vitamin E USP in a 50-cm2 matrix and 2) 27 mg xanomeline freebase with 0.03 mg
    Vitamin E USP in a 25-cm2 matrix. For a detailed description of the composition
    of</p>

    <p>these formulations please refer to Part II, Section 14 of the Xanomeline (LY246708)
    Clinical Investigator''s Brochure. For characterization of the safety, tolerance,
    and pharmacokinetics of xanomeline TTS Formulations A, B, and E, please refer
    to Part II, Sections 7, 8, and 10 of the Xanomeline (LY246708) Clinical Investigator''s
    Brochure. Formulation E will be studied in this protocol, H2Q-MC-LZZT(c).</p>'

  sectionTitle: Summary of Study Design
  text: '<p>Patients with probable mild to moderate AD will be studied in a randomized,
    double-blind, parallel (3 arm), placebo-controlled trial of 26 weeks duration.
    The study will be conducted on an outpatient basis. Approximately 300 patients
    will be enrolled (see Schedule of Events for Protocol H2Q-MC-LZZT(c), Attachment
    LZZT.1).</p>

    <p>Following informed consent, patients will be screened at Visit 1. At screening,
    patients will undergo complete neuropsychiatric assessment, psychometric testing,
    and general medical assessment (including medical history, pre-existing conditions,
    physical examination). In addition, vital signs, temperature, medication history,
    electrocardiogram (ECG), chest x-ray, and safety laboratories will be obtained.
    During the screening visit, patients will wear a placebo TTS to determine willingness
    and ability to comply with transdermal administration procedures. If patients
    have not had central nervous system (CNS) imaging in the previous 12 months, a
    computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan will be obtained.
    If patients are insulin dependent diabetics, a hemoglobin A 1c will be obtained.
    Screening exams and procedures may be performed after Visit 1; however, their
    results must be completed and available prior to randomization. The screening
    process should occur within 2 weeks of randomization (Visit 3 of the study).</p>

    <p>Patients who meet enrollment criteria from Visit 1 will proceed to Visit 2
    at which time they will undergo a 24-hour Ambulatory ECG. At Visit 3 the Ambulatory
    ECG will be removed and patients will be randomized to 1 of 3 treatment arms.
    The treatment arms will include a placebo arm, a low-dose xanomeline arm (50 cm
    2 TTS Formulation E, 54 mg xanomeline), and a high-dose xanomeline arm (75 cm
    2 TTS Formulation E, 81 mg xanomeline). All patients receiving xanomeline will
    be started at 50 cm 2 TTS Formulation E. For the first 8 weeks of treatment, patients
    will be assessed at clinic visits every 2 weeks and, thereafter, at clinic visits
    every 4 weeks. Patients who discontinue prior to Visit 12 (Week 24) will be brought
    back for full efficacy assessments at or near to 24 weeks, whenever possible.</p>

    <p>A Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB), chaired by an external cardiologist,
    will meet after 75, 150, 225, and 300 patients have completed 1 month of treatment.
    The DSMB will review cardiovascular findings to decide if discontinuation of the
    study or any treatment arm is appropriate, if additional cardiovascular monitoring
    is required, if further cardiovascular monitoring is unnecessary, or if adjustment
    of dose within a treatment arm (or arms) is appropriate (see Section 3.9.4).</p>

    <p>At Visits 3, 8, 10, and 12, efficacy instruments (ADAS-Cog, CIBIC+, and DAD)
    will be administered. NPI-X will be administered at 2-week intervals either at
    clinic visits or via a telephone interview. Vital signs, temperature, and an assessment
    of adverse events will</p>

    <p>be obtained at all clinic visits. An electrocardiogram (ECG), and chemistry/hematology
    safety labs will be obtained at Visits 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, and 13. Urinalysis
    will be done at Visits 4, 9, and 12. Use of concomitant medications will be collected
    at Visits 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, and 13. Plasma levels of xanomeline and
    metabolites will be obtained at Visits 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, and 11. At Visits 3, 4,
    5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12, medications will be dispensed to the patients.</p>

    <p>Visits 1 through 13 should be scheduled relative to Visit 3 (Week 0 - randomization).
    Visits 4, 5, 7, 8, and 13 should occur within 3 days of their scheduled date.
    Visits 9, 10, 11, and 12 should occur within 4 days of their scheduled date. At
    Visit 13 patients will be given the option to enter the open-label extension phase
    (see Section 3.10.3. Study Extensions).</p>

  sectionTitle: Discussion of Design and Control
  text: '<p>Previous studies of the oral formulation have shown that xanomeline tartrate
    may improve behavior and cognition. Effects on behavior are manifest within 2
    to 4 weeks of initiation of treatment. The same studies have shown that 8 to 12
    weeks are required to demonstrate effects on cognition and clinical global assessment.
    This study is intended to determine the acute and chronic effects of the TTS formulation
    in AD; for that reason, the study is of 26 weeks duration. Dosage specification
    has been made on the basis of tolerance to the xanomeline TTS in a clinical pharmacology
    study (H2Q-EW-LKAA), and target plasma levels as determined in studies of the
    oral formulation of xanomeline (H2Q-MC-LZZA).</p>

    <p>The parallel dosing regimen maximizes the ability to make direct comparisons
    between the treatment groups. The use of placebo allows for a blinded, thus minimally
    biased, study. The placebo treatment group is a comparator group for efficacy
    and safety assessment.</p>

    <p>Two interim analyses are planned for this study. The first interim analysis
    will occur when 50% of the patients have completed Visit 8 (8 weeks). If required,
    the second interim analysis will occur when 50% of the patients have completed
    Visit 12 (24 weeks). (See Section 4.6, Interim Analyses.)</p>'

    \ of Visit 1. The patient's and caregiver's willingness to comply with 26 weeks\
    \ of transdermal therapy should be elicited, and those patients/caregivers unwilling\
    \ to comply should be excluded.</p>\n<p>Upon enrollment at Visit 3, and on the\
    \ morning of each subsequent day of therapy , xanomeline or placebo will be administered\
    \ with the application of 2 adhesive patches, one 50 cm2 in area, the other 25\
    \ cm2 in area. Each morning, prior to the application of the patches, hydrocortisone\
    \ cream (1%) should be applied to the skin at the intended site of administration,\
    \ rubbed in, and allowed to penetrate for approximately 30 minutes. Thereafter,\
    \ excess cream should be wiped away and the patches applied.</p>\n<p>The patches\
    \ are to be worn continuously throughout the day, for a period of approximately\
    \ 12 to 14 hours, and removed in the evening. After removal of the patches, hydrocortisone\
    \ cream (1%) should be applied locally to the site of administration.</p>\n<p>Patches\
    \ should be applied to a dry, intact, non-hairy area. Applying the patch to a\
    \ shaved area is not recommended. The application site of the patches should be\

    <p>Sunday \nMonday \nTuesday \nWednesday \nThursday \nFriday \nSaturday</p>\n\
    <p>right or left upper arm \nright or left upper back \nright or left lower back\

    \ \nright or left upper thigh \nright or left upper chest</p>\n<p>Patients and\
    \ caregivers are free to select either the left or right site within the constraints\
    \ of the rotation schedule noted above. Patches should be applied at approximately\
    \ the same time each day. For patients who habitually bathe in the morning, the\
    \ patient should bathe prior to application of new patches. Every effort should\
    \ be taken to allow for morning administration of the patches. Exceptions allowing\
    \ administration of TTS patches at night instead of in the morning will be made\
    \ on a case-by-case basis by the CRO medical monitor. In the event that some adhesive\
    \ remains on the patient's skin and cannot be removed with normal bathing, a special\
    \ solution will be provided to remove the adhesive.</p>\n<p>Following randomization\
    \ at Visit 3, patients will be instructed to call the site if they have difficulty\
    \ with application or wearing of patches. In the event that a patch becomes detached,\
    \ a new patch of the same size should be applied (at earliest convenience) to\
    \ an area of the dermis adjacent to the detachment site, and the rotation schedule\
    \ should be resumed the following morning. If needed, the edges of the patch may\
    \ be secured with a special adhesive tape that will be provided. If daily doses\
    \ are reduced, improperly administered, or if a patch becomes detached and requires\
    \ application of a new patch on three or more days in any 30-day period, the CRO\
    \ research physician will be notified.</p>\n<p>If the daily dose is reduced or\

    \ ways:</p>\n<p>\u2022 The rash is confined to sites of application.</p>\n<p>\u2022\
    \ The rash may be associated with pruritus.</p>\n<p>\u2022 In 5% of cases of rash\
    \ observed in the Interim Analysis, blistering has \nbeen observed.</p>\n<p>\u2022\
    \ The onset of rash may occur at any time during the course of the study.</p>\n\
    <p>\u2022 A moderate eosinophilia (0.6-1.5 x 103 /microliter) is associated with\
    \ rash \nand has been noted in approximately 10% of patients.</p>\n<p>It does\
    \ not appear that the rash constitutes a significant safety risk; however, it\

    <p><b>Skin Rash Follow-up</b></p>\n<p>For patients who exit the study or its extension\
    \ with rash at the site(s) of application:</p>\n<p>a)  Approximately 2 weeks after\

    \ rash who have \npreviously exited the study or its extension should be contacted\
    \ at \nearliest convenience.)</p>\n<p>b)  If caregiver states unequivocally that\
    \ skin problems have completely \nresolved, no further follow-up is needed.</p>\n\
    <p>c)  If caregiver reports scarring and/or other problems, patient should \n\
    return to clinic for a follow-up visit. The skin rash questionnaire \nshould again\
    \ be completed. If in the opinion of the investigator, \nfurther follow-up is\

    \ Because both of these variables must reach statistical significance, an adjustment\
    \ to the nominal p-values is necessary in order to maintain a .05 Type I error\
    \ rate for this study. This adjustment is described in detail in Section 4.3.5.</p>\n\
    <p>The DAD will be analyzed with respect to the total score, as well as the subscores\
    \ of \ninitiation, planning and organization, and effective performance. This\
    \ variable is \nconsidered a secondary variable in the US, but is a third primary\
    \ variable in Europe.</p>\n<p>The NPI-X is a secondary variable. The primary assessment\
    \ of this instrument will be for the total score, not including the sleep, appetite,\
    \ and euphoria domains. This total score is computed by taking the product of\
    \ the frequency and severity scores and summing them up across the domains. Secondary\
    \ variables derived from the NPI-X include evaluating each domain/behavior separately.\
    \ Also, caregiver distress from the NPI-X will be analyzed.</p>\n<p>ADAS-Cog (14)\
    \ and each of the 14 individual components will also be analyzed. In addition,\
    \ a subscore of the ADAS-Cog will be computed and analyzed, based on results from\
    \ a previous large study of oral xanomeline. This subscore, referred to as ADAS-Cog\
    \ (4), will be the sum of constructional praxis, orientation, spoken language\
    \ ability, and word finding difficulty in spontaneous speech.</p>\n<p>Any computed\
    \ total score will be treated as missing if more than 30% of the items are missing\
    \ or scored \u201Cnot applicable\u201D. For example, when computing ADAS-Cog(11),\
    \ if 4 or more items are missing, then the total score will not be computed. When\
    \ one or more items are missing (but not more than 30%), the total score will\
    \ be adjusted in order to maintain the full range of the scale. For example, ADAS-Cog(11)\
    \ is a 0-70 scale. If the first item, Word Recall (ranges from 0 to 10), is missing,\
    \ then the remaining 10 items of the ADAS-Cog(11) will be summed and multiplied\
    \ by (70 / (70-10) ), or 7/6. This computation will occur for all totals and subtotals\
    \ of ADAS-Cog and NPI-X. DAD is a 40 item questionnaire where each question is\
    \ scored as either \u201C0\u201D or \u201C1\u201D. The DAD total score and component\
    \ scores are reported as percentage of items that are scored \u201C1\u201D. So\
    \ if items of the DAD are \u201Cnot applicable\u201D or missing, the percentage\
    \ will be computed for only those items that are scored. As an example, if two\
    \ items are missing (leaving 38 that are scored), and there are 12 items scored\
    \ as \u201C1\u201D, the rest as \u201C0\u201D, then the DAD score is 12/38=.316.</p>"

    \ \u201Ctainted.\u201D Also, by requiring 2 weeks of therapy prior to use of the\
    \ NPI-X data, the treatment difference should be maximized by giving the drug\
    \ 2 weeks to work, thereby increasing the statistical power. Secondary analyses\
    \ of the NPI-X will include the average of all postrandomization weeks, including\
    \ measures obtained at Weeks 2 and 26.</p>"

  sectionTitle: Statistical Methodology
  text: "<p>The primary method to be used for the primary efficacy variables described\
    \ in Sections 4.3.1 and 4.3.2 will be analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), except\
    \ for CIBIC+ which is a score that reflects change from baseline, so there is\
    \ no corresponding baseline CIBIC+ score. Effects in the ANCOVA model will be\
    \ the corresponding baseline score, investigator, and treatment. CIBIC+ will be\
    \ analyzed by analysis of variance (ANOVA), with effects in the model being investigator\
    \ and treatment. Investigator-by-treatment interaction will be tested in a full\
    \ model prior to conducting the primary ANCOVA or ANOVA (see description below).</p>\n\
    <p>Because 3 treatment groups are involved, the primary analysis will be the test\
    \ for linear dose response in the ANCOVA and ANOVA models described in the preceding\
    \ paragraph. The result is then a single p-value for each of ADAS-Cog and CIBIC+.</p>\n\
    <p>Analysis of the secondary efficacy variables will also be ANCOVA. Pairwise\
    \ treatment comparisons of the adjusted means for all efficacy variables will\
    \ be conducted using a LSMEANS statement within the GLM procedure.</p>\n<p>Investigator-by-treatment\
    \ interaction will be tested in a full ANCOVA or ANOVA model, which takes the\
    \ models described above, and adds the interaction term to the model. Interaction\
    \ will be tested at \u03B1 = .10 level. When the interaction is significant at\
    \ this level, the data will be examined for each individual investigator to attempt\
    \ to identify the source of the significant interaction. When the interaction\
    \ is not significant, this term will be dropped from the model as described above,\
    \ to test for investigator and treatment main effects. By doing so, all ANCOVA\
    \ and ANOVA models will be able to validly test for treatment differences without\
    \ weighting each investigator equally, which is what occurs when using Type III\
    \ sums of squares (cell means model) with the interaction term</p>\n<p>present\
    \ in the model. This equal weighting of investigators can become a serious problem\
    \ when sample sizes are dramatically different between investigators.</p>\n<p>For\
    \ all ANOVA and ANCOVA models, data collected from investigators who enrolled\
    \ fewer than 3 patients in any one treatment group will be combined prior to analysis.\
    \ If this combination still results in a treatment group having fewer than 3 patients\
    \ in any one treatment group, then this group of patients will be combined with\
    \ the next fewestenrolling investigator. In the event that there is a tie for\
    \ fewest-enrolling investigator, one of these will be chosen at random by a random-number\
    \ generator.</p>\n<p>The inherent assumption of normally distributed data will\
    \ be evaluated by generating output for the residuals from the full ANCOVA and\
    \ ANOVA models, which include the interaction term, and by testing for normality\
    \ using the Shapiro-Wilk test from PROC UNIVARIATE. In the event that the data\
    \ are predominantly nonnormally distributed, analyses will also be conducted on\
    \ the ranked data. This rank transformation will be applied by ranking all the\
    \ data for a particular variable, across all investigators and treatments, from\
    \ lowest to highest. Integer ranks will be assigned starting at 1; mean ranks\
    \ will be assigned when ties occur.</p>\n<p>In addition, the NPI-X will be analyzed\
    \ in a manner similar to typical analyses of adverse events. In this analysis,\
    \ each behavior will be considered individually. This analysis is referred to\
    \ as \u201Ctreatment-emergent signs and symptoms\u201D (TESS) analysis. For each\
    \ behavior, the patients will be dichotomized into 1 of 2 groups: those who experienced\
    \ the behavior for the first time postrandomization, or those who had the quotient\
    \ between frequency and severity increase relative to the baseline period defines\
    \ one group. All other patients are in the second group. Treatments will be compared\
    \ for overall differences by Cochran-Mantel-Haentzel (CMH) test referred to in\
    \ SAS\xAE as \u201Crow mean scores differ,\u201D 2 degrees of freedom. The CMH\

  sectionTitle: One-sided Justification
  text: "<p>All comparisons between xanomeline and placebo with respect to efficacy\
    \ variables should be one-sided. The justification for this follows.</p>\n<p>The\
    \ statistical hypothesis that is tested needs to be consistent with the ultimate\
    \ data-based decision that is reached. When conducting placebo-controlled trials,\
    \ it is imperative that the drug be demonstrated to be superior in efficacy to\
    \ placebo, since equivalent or worse efficacy than placebo will preclude approvability.\
    \ Consequently, a one-sided test for efficacy is required.</p>\n<p>The null hypothesis\
    \ is that the drug is equal or worse than placebo. The alternative hypothesis\
    \ is that the drug has greater efficacy than placebo. A Type I error occurs only\
    \ when it is concluded that a study drug is effective when in fact it is not.\
    \ This can occur in only one tail of the distribution of the treatment difference.\
    \ Further details of the</p>\n<p>arguments for one-sided tests in placebo-controlled\
    \ trials are available in statistical publications (Fisher 1991; Koch 1991; Overall\
    \ 1991; and Peace 1991).</p>\n<p>The argument for one-sided tests does not necessarily\
    \ transfer to safety measures, in general, because one can accept a certain level\
    \ of toxicity in the presence of strong efficacy. That is, safety is evaluated\
    \ as part of a benefit/risk ratio.</p>\n<p>Note that this justification is similar\
    \ to that used by regulatory agencies worldwide that routinely require one-sided\
    \ tests for toxicological oncogenicity studies. In that case, the interest is\
    \ not in whether a drug seems to lessen the occurrence of cancer; the interest\
    \ is in only one tail of the distribution, namely whether the drug causes cancer\
    \ to a greater extent than the control.</p>\n<p>Different regulatory agencies\
    \ require different type I error rates. Treatment differences that are significant\
    \ at the .025 \u03B1-level will be declared to be \u201Cstatistically significant.\u201D\
    \ When a computed p-value falls between .025 and .05, the differences will be\
    \ described as \u201Cmarginally statistically significant.\u201D This approach\
    \ satisfies regulatory agencies who have accepted a one-sided test at the .05\
    \ level, and other regulatory agencies who have requested a two-sided test at\
    \ the .05 level, or equivalently, a one-sided test at the .025 level. In order\
    \ to facilitate the review of the final study report, two-sided p-values will\
    \ be presented in addition to the one-sided p-values.</p>"

  sectionTitle: Nominal P-value Adjustments
  text: "<p>When there are multiple outcomes, and the study drug is declared to be\
    \ effective when at least one of these outcomes achieves statistical significance\
    \ in comparison with a placebo control, a downward adjustment to the nominal \u03B1\
    -level is necessary. A well-known simple method is the Bonferroni method, that\
    \ divides the overall Type I error rate, usually .05, by the number of multiple\
    \ outcomes. So, for example, if there are two multiple outcomes, the study drug\
    \ is declared to be effective if at least one of the two outcomes is significant\
    \ at the .05/2 or .025 level.</p>\n<p>However, when one has the situation that\
    \ is present in this study, where there are 2 (or 3 for Europe) outcome variables,\
    \ each of which must be statistically significant, then the adjustment of the\
    \ nominal levels is in the opposite direction, that is upwards, in order to maintain\
    \ an overall Type 1 error rate of .05.</p>\n<p>In the case of two outcomes, ADAS-Cog\
    \ (11) and CIBIC+, if the two variables were completely independent, then each\
    \ variable should be tested at the nominal \u03B1-level of .05 1/2 = .2236 level.\
    \ So if both variables resulted in a nominal p-value less than or equal to .2236,\
    \ then we would declare the study drug to be effective at the overall Type 1 error\
    \ rate of .05.</p>\n<p>We expect these two outcome measures to be correlated.\
    \ From the first large-scale \nefficacy study of oral xanomeline, Study MC-H2Q-LZZA,\
    \ the correlation between \nCIBIC+ and the change in ADAS-Cog(11) from baseline\
    \ was .252. Consequently, we</p>\n<p>plan to conduct a randomization test to combine\
    \ these two dependent dose-response p-values into a single test, which will then\
    \ be at the .05 Type I error level. Because there will be roughly 300!/(3 * 100!)\
    \ possible permutations of the data, random data permutations will be sampled\
    \ (10,000 random permutations).</p>\n<p>Designate the dose response p-values as\
    \ p1 and p2 (computed as one-sided p-values), for ADAS-Cog(11) and CIBIC+, respectively.\
    \ The rejection region is defined as</p>\n<p>[ {p1 \u2264 \u03B1 and p2 \u2264\
    \ \u03B1} ].</p>\n<p>The critical value, \u03B1, will be determined from the 10,000\
    \ random permutations by choosing the value of \u03B1 to be such that 2.5% of\
    \ the 10,000 computed pairs of dose response p-values fall in the rejection region.\
    \ This will correspond to a one-sided test at the .025 level, or equivalently\
    \ a two-sided test at the .05 level. In addition, by determining the percentage\
    \ of permuted samples that are more extreme than the observed data, a single p-value\
    \ is obtained.</p>"

  text: '<p>Although safety data is collected at the 24 week visit for retrieved dropouts,
    these data will not be included in the primary analysis of safety.</p>

    <p>Pearson''s chi-square test will be used to analyze 3 reasons for study discontinuation
    (protocol completed, lack of efficacy, and adverse event), the incidence of abnormal
    (high or low) laboratory measures during the postrandomization phase, and the
    incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events. The analysis of laboratory data
    is conducted by comparing the measures to the normal reference ranges (based on
    a large Lilly database), and counting patients in the numerator if they ever had
    a high (low) value during the postrandomization phase.</p>

    <p>Additionally, for the continuous laboratory tests, an analysis of change from

    on the ranks.</p>

    <p>Several outcome measures will be extracted and analyzed from the Ambulatory
    ECG tapes, including number of pauses, QT interval, and AV block (first, second,

    \ The Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale\u2212Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog)\
    \ is an instrument devised to assess the severity of cognitive impairment in patients\
    \ with Alzheimer's Disease (AD). The scale includes short neuropsychological tests\
    \ in which the patient performs simple tasks such as word recall, word recognition,\
    \ and constructional praxis. The cognitive section of the ADAS consists of 11\
    \ items which assess the following: memory, language (aphasia), and motor skills\
    \ (praxis).</p>\n<p>Rosen et al (1984) evaluated the test-retest and interrater\
    \ reliabilities of the individual scale items and the entire scale in patients\
    \ with dementia of the Alzheimer's type. The ADAS was shown to be valid (Rosen\
    \ et al, 1984) in the ability to detect patients with clinically diagnosed AD\
    \ from matched nondemented controls. Kramer-Ginzberg et al (1988) demonstrated\
    \ at 12 month and 24 month retesting that higher scores on the ADAS correlated\
    \ with disease progression. Because both of the above cognitive and noncognitive\
    \ parameters are assessed, the ADAS is a reliable instrument for use in psychopharmacologic\
    \ trials involving patients with AD.</p>\n<p>Three additional items have been\
    \ incorporated into this scale to asses the attention/concentration level of the\
    \ patient. The three additional tasks are delayed word recall, attention/visual\
    \ search task, and maze solution. These tasks and their rating scales were developed\
    \ by the author of the ADAS-Cog.</p>\n<p><b>Equipment Needed:</b></p>\n<p>The\
    \ following props are needed to carry out the ADAS-Cog with attention/concentration\
    \ tasks:</p>\n<p class=\"p14\">1. Toys which are replicas of the objects to be\
    \ named.</p>\n<p class=\"p14\">2. Sets of index cards for the word recall, delayed\
    \ word recall and word recognition \nitems. For each administration of the ADAS\
    \ there is a designated set of cards \nspecific for that visit and the words are\
    \ different for each visit.</p>\n<p class=\"p14\">3. Scaled drawings of the forms\
    \ that the patients will copy.</p>\n<p class=\"p14\">4. Sets of mazes for the\
    \ maze solution task.</p>\n<p class=\"p14\">5. Sets of numbers and letters for\
    \ the attention/visual search task.</p>\n<p>All of these items will be supplied\
    \ by Eli Lilly and Company.</p>\n<p><span class=\"s50\"><b>Tes</b></span><b>t</b>\

    ><b>an</b></span><b>d</b> <span class=\"s50\"><b>Scorin</b></span><b>g</b> The\
    \ ADAS-Cog with attention/concentration tasks should be administered by a health\
    \ care professional trained to do so. The test will take approximately 30-45 minutes\
    \ to complete and involves interviewing the patient alone.</p>\n<p>There are a\
    \ total of 11 items which assess cognitive function and 3 which assess attention/concentration.\
    \ The maximum total score is 90. 70 points are possible on the cognitive section\
    \ and 20 points on the attention/concentration section. The higher the score,\
    \ the greater is the degree of cognitive impairment.</p>\n<p>The following is\
    \ the sequence in which the ADAS-Cog with attention/concentration tasks is to\
    \ be administered along with test instructions and scoring guidelines:</p>\n<p><b>1.\
    \ Word Recall</b></p>\n<p>The patient reads aloud 10 high imagery-words exposed\
    \ for 2 seconds each. The patient then recalls the words aloud. Three trials of\
    \ reading and recall are given. On the worksheet, check each word recalled correctly.\
    \ The words not checked are added and the total score is divided by 3 to generate\
    \ a score for this item. The score equals the mean number of words not recalled\
    \ on the 3 trials (maximum = 10).</p>\n<p><b>2. Naming Objects and Fingers</b></p>\n\
    <p>The patient is asked to name 12 randomly presented real objects, with frequency\
    \ identification levels of high, medium, and low. For those patients having difficulty\
    \ naming objects, standard clues may be used. The following is a list of the objects,\
    \ their frequency of identification, and clues:</p>\n<p><b>High Frequency:</b></p>\n\
    <p class=\"p14\"><span class=\"s52\">Objec</span>t Flower Bed Whistle Pencil</p>\n\
    <p class=\"p14\">Clue \ngrows in a garden \nused for sleeping \nmakes a sound\
    \ when blown \nused for writing</p>\n<p><b>Medium Frequency:</b></p>\n<p class=\"\
    p14\"><span class=\"s52\">Objec</span>t Rattle Mask Scissors Comb</p>\n<p class=\"\
    p14\">Clue a baby's toy hides your face cuts paper used on hair</p>\n<p><b>Low\
    \ Frequency:</b></p>\n<p class=\"p14\"><span class=\"s52\">Objec</span>t Wallet\
    \ Harmonica Stethoscope Tongs</p>\n<p class=\"p14\">Clue \nholds your money \n\
    a musical instrument \ndoctor uses it to listen to your heart \npicks up food</p>\n\
    <p>Also, ask the patient to name the fingers of his dominant hand; thumb, pinky\
    \ (little finger), index (pointer, forefinger), middle and ring fingers.</p>\n\
    <p>Check each object/finger on the worksheet named correctly. In order to correctly\
    \ score, the patient must name each object exactly as stated on the worksheet,\
    \ exceptions include wallet which could also be called a billfold, index finger\
    \ which could also be referred to as the pointer or forefinger and pinky which\
    \ could also be called little finger.</p>\n<p>Add the number of empty boxes and\
    \ then score this item using the following scale:</p>\n<p class=\"p14\">Items\
    \ = objects and fingers named \n0 = 0-2 items named incorrectly \n1 = 3-5 items\
    \ named incorrectly \n2 = 6-8 items named incorrectly \n3 = 9-11 items named incorrectly\
    \ \n4 = 12-14 items named incorrectly \n5 = 15-17 items named incorrectly</p>\n\
    <p><b>3. Delayed Word Recall</b></p>\n<p>The patient is asked if they remember\
    \ any of the 10 words used in the first task. On the worksheet, check each word\
    \ recalled correctly. The words not checked are added to generate a score for\
    \ this task. (maximum = 10)</p>\n<p><b>4. Commands</b></p>\n<p>The patient is\
    \ instructed to perform the following 5 commands. Receptive speech is assessed\
    \ based on the patient's ability to carry out 1 to 5 step commands.</p>\n<p class=\"\
    p14\">1. Make a fist.</p>\n<p class=\"p14\">2. Point to the ceiling and then to\
    \ the floo<span class=\"s52\">r</span>. \nLine up a pencil, watch, and card on\
    \ the table in front of the patient.</p>\n<p class=\"p14\">3. Put the pencil on\
    \ top of the card and then put it back.</p>\n<p class=\"p14\">4. Put the watch\
    \ on the other side of the pencil and then turn over the card.</p>\n<p class=\"\
    p14\">5. Tap each shoulder twice, with two fingers, keeping your eyes shut.</p>\n\
    <p class=\"p14\">Each underlined word represents a single step. The command may\
    \ be repeated once by the interviewer. Each command is scored as a whole. That\
    \ is, each part of the command must be performed accurately to obtain credit for\
    \ that item. One the worksheet, check each command performed correctly and then\
    \ add up the empty boxes. The scale for scoring this item is as follows:</p>\n\
    <p class=\"p14\">0 = no errors, all 5 commands correct 1 = 1 command incorrect,\
    \ 4 commands correct 2 = 2 commands incorrect, 3 commands correct 3 = 3 commands\
    \ incorrect, 2 commands correct 4 = 4 commands incorrect, 1 command correct 5\
    \ = all 5 commands incorrect</p>\n<p><b>5. Constructional Praxis</b></p>\n<p>This\
    \ item assesses the patient's ability to copy 4 geometric forms. These forms,\
    \ in the order of presentation are:</p>\n<p class=\"p14\">1. Circle: approximately\
    \ 2.0 cm in diameter</p>\n<p class=\"p14\">2. Two overlapping rectangles: the\
    \ vertical rectangle is 2.0 cm x 2.5 cm, and the \nhorizontal rectangle is 1.0\
    \ cm x 3.5 cm.</p>\n<p class=\"p14\">3. Rhombus: each side = 2.0 cm, acute angle\
    \ = 50 degrees, obtuse angle = 130 \ndegrees</p>\n<p class=\"p14\">4. Cube: each\
    \ side = 2.0 cm, internal lines are present.</p>\n<p>Each figure is located in\
    \ the upper middle of a 5 1/2 x 8 1/2 sheet of paper. The patient is instructed:\
    \ <b>\u201CDo you see this figure? Make one that looks like the one anywhere on\
    \ the paper.\u201D</b> Two attempts are permitted. One the worksheet check each\
    \ figure drawn correctly. The scoring of this item is as follows:</p>\n<p class=\"\
    p14\">1 = 1 form drawn incorrectly \n2 = 2 forms drawn incorrectly \n3 = 3 forms\
    \ drawn incorrectly \n4 = 4 forms drawn incorrectly \n5 = no figures drawn: scribbles,\
    \ parts of forms, words instead of forms</p>\n<p>Scoring criteria for each form:</p>\n\
    <p class=\"p14\">1. Circle: a closed figure</p>\n<p class=\"p14\">2. Two overlapping\
    \ rectangles: forms must be 4-sided and overlap must be similar \nto presented\
    \ form. Changes in size are not scored.</p>\n<p class=\"p14\">3. Rhombus (diamond):\
    \ figure must be 4-sided obliquely oriented, and the sides \napproximately equal\
    \ in length. Four measurements are taken. \nThese are: ac, a'c, bc, b'c. \nThe\
    \ ratio of ac/a'c or a'c/ac ranges from 0.75 to 1.00. \nThe ratio of bc/b'c or\
    \ b'c/bc ranges from 0.60 to 1.00. \nThe ratio bb'/aa' ranges from 0.30 to 0.75.\
    \ \nThe figure is incorrect if any ratio is outside these ranges.</p>\n<p class=\"\
    p14\">4. Cube: the form is 3-dimensional, with front face in the correct orientation,\
    \ \ninternal lines drawn correctly between corners. If opposite sides of faces\
    \ are not \nparallel by more than 20 degrees, it is incorrect (insert examples\
    \ of drawings).</p>\n<p><b>6. Ideational Praxis</b></p>\n<p>The patient is given\
    \ a 8 1/2\" x 11\" sheet of paper and a long envelope. The patient is instructed\
    \ to pretend to send a letter to himself. The patient is told to fold the paper,\
    \ put the paper into the envelope, seal it, address it to himself, and to indicate\
    \ where the stamp goes.</p>\n<p>If the patient forgets part of the task or is\
    \ having difficulty, reinstruction should be given. Impairment on this term should\
    \ only reflect dysfunction in executing an overlearned task only and not recall\
    \ difficulty. The 5 components to this task are:</p>\n<p class=\"p14\">1. fold\
    \ letter</p>\n<p class=\"p14\">2. put letter in envelope</p>\n<p class=\"p14\"\
    >3. seal envelope</p>\n<p class=\"p14\">4. address envelope (any address containing:\
    \ name, street, city, state, and zip code \nis correct)</p>\n<p class=\"p14\"\
    >5. mark where stamp goes</p>\n<p>On the worksheet check each step completed correctly.\
    \ Scoring this item is as follows:</p>\n<p class=\"p14\">0 = able to perform all\
    \ components 1 = failure to perform 1 component 2 = failure to perform 2 components\
    \ 3 = failure to perform 3 components 4 = failure to perform 4 components 5 =\
    \ failure to perform 5 components</p>\n<p><b>7. Orientation</b></p>\n<p>The patient\
    \ is asked questions which assess orientation. The components of orientation assessed\
    \ are: full name, month, date, year, day, season, place, and time of day. On the\
    \ worksheet check each correct response. One point is given for each incorrect\
    \ response (maximum of 8). Acceptable answers include 1 day either way within\
    \ the date: within 1 hour for the hour, partial name for place, naming the upcoming\
    \ season if it is 1 week prior to its onset, or naming the previous season for\
    \ two weeks after its termination.</p>\n<p><b>8. Word Recognition Task</b></p>\n\
    <p>The patient reads aloud 12 high-imagery words presented on index cards. Then\
    \ these words are mixed in randomly with 12 new words. The patient indicates if\
    \ he has previously seen the word by saying \u201Cyes\u201D or \u201Cold\u201D\
    \ and if the word is new by saying \u201Cno\u201D or \u201Cnew.\u201D Two more\
    \ trials of reading the original words and recognition are given. On the worksheet\
    \ check each word recalled correctly. Words that are starred are the original\
    \ words and patients should answer by saying \u201Cyes\u201D or \u201Cold.\u201D\
    \ Words that are not starred are new words and the patient should respond by saying\
    \ \u201Cno\u201D or \u201Cnew.\u201D The score equals the mean number of incorrect\
    \ responses for 3 trials (maximum 12).</p>\n<p><b>9. Attention/Visual Search Task</b></p>\n\
    <p>Place the example face up in front of the subject. Say to the subject \u201C\
    This is an example of the task we are about to do. On the top of this page is\
    \ a number (or in some cases a number and letter). Throughout the page you will\
    \ find this number mixed in with the other numbers. I'd like you to begin here\
    \ (point to the beginning of the first line), and going across line by line, cross\
    \ out any number that matches the number at the top of the page. Please work as\
    \ quickly as you can.\u201D Discontinue the example after 30 seconds.</p>\n<p>Prior\
    \ to each task, you may repeat the instructions to the subject. Discontinue each\
    \ task after 60 seconds. (maximum = 40 targets)</p>\n<p><b>10. Maze Solution Task</b></p>\n\
    <p>The subject will be required to attempt each maze in order of difficulty. Difficulty\
    \ was varied by manipulating features of the maze such as the number of turns,\
    \ number of</p>\n<p>decision points, and length of dead end routes. There is a\
    \ time limit of 240 seconds for each maze. Two errors, or reaching the 240 second\
    \ time limit constitutes a failure.</p>\n<p>Show the example. Tell them to start\
    \ where it says \u201Cstart\u201D and find their way outside the maze. Show them\
    \ where they would come out. Tell them to try not to run into any dead ends or\
    \ cross solid lines. You can help them in the example if they hit a dead end.\
    \ If they hit a dead end during the test you may show them the correct path once.\
    \ (maximum = 240 seconds)</p>\n<p><b>Language</b></p>\n<p>Language abilities are\
    \ evaluated throughout the interview and on specific tests. Questions eliciting\
    \ \u201Cyes\u201D or \u201Cno\u201D answers assess comprehension on a very basic\
    \ level. Other questions require recall of specific information and well developed\
    \ communication skills. The following 4 items (8-11) assess spoken language ability,\
    \ comprehension, remembering test instructions and word finding difficulty in\
    \ spontaneous speech.</p>\n<p><b>11. Spoken Language Ability</b></p>\n<p>This\
    \ item is a global rating of the quality of the patient's speech such as clarity\
    \ and difficulty in making oneself understood. Quantity and word finding difficulty\
    \ are not rated on this item. The scoring for this item is as follows:</p>\n<p\
    \ class=\"p14\">0 = no impairment: patient speaks clearly and is understandable\
    \ \n1 = very mild: 1 instance of lack of understandability \n2 = mild: patient\
    \ has difficulty &lt;25% of the time \n3 = moderate: patient has difficulty 25-50%\
    \ of the time \n4 = moderately severe: patient has difficulty more than 50% of\
    \ the time \n5 = severe: only 1 or 2 utterances, clued by empty speech, mute</p>\n\
    <p><b>12. Comprehension</b></p>\n<p>This item evaluates the patient's ability\
    \ to understand speech. Do not include responses to commands. The scoring for\
    \ this item is as follows:</p>\n<p class=\"p14\">0 = no impairment: patient understands\
    \ \n1 = very mild: 1 instance of misunderstanding \n2 = mild: 2-5 instances of\
    \ misunderstanding \n3 = moderate: requires several repetitions and rephrasing\
    \ \n4 = moderately severe: patient only occasionally responds correctly (that\
    \ is, to yes</p>\n<p class=\"p14\">questions) \n5 = severe: patient rarely responds\
    \ to questions appropriately, not due to poverty of</p>\n<p class=\"p14\">speech</p>\n\
    <p><b>13. Word-Finding Difficulty in Spontaneous Speech</b></p>\n<p>This item\
    \ assesses whether the patient has difficulty in finding the desired word in spontaneous\
    \ speech. The problem may be circumlocution (that is, giving explanatory phrases)\
    \ or substituting nearly satisfactory synonyms. The score represents a subjective\
    \ rating by the interviewer. Do not include responses to the finger or object\
    \ naming during the testing in this rating. The scoring for this item is as follows:</p>\n\
    <p class=\"p14\">0 = none</p>\n<p class=\"p14\">1 = very mild: 1 or 2 instances,\
    \ not clinically significant \n2 = mild: noticeable circumlocution or synonym\
    \ substitution \n3 = moderate: loss of words without compensation on occasion\
    \ \n4 = moderately severe: frequent loss of words without compensation</p>\n<p>5\
    \ = severe: nearly total loss of content words, speech sounds empty, 1-2 word\
    \ utterances</p>\n<p><b>14. Recall of Test Instructions</b></p>\n<p>The patient's\
    \ ability to remember the requirements of the word recognition task is evaluated.\
    \ On each recognition trial, the patient is asked prior to presentation of the\
    \ first 2 words, <b>\u201CDid you see this word before or is this a new word?\
    \ \u201D</b> For the third word, the patient is asked, <b>\" How about this one?\
    \ \"</b> If the patient responds appropriately (that is, \u201Cyes\u201D or \u201C\
    no\u201D) then the recall of the instruction is accurate. If the patient fails\
    \ to respond, this signifies that the instructions have been forgotten. Then instruction\
    \ is repeated. The procedure used for the third word is repeated for words 4-24.\
    \ Each instance of recall failure is noted. The scoring for this item is as follows:</p>\n\
    <p class=\"p14\">0 = no impairment \n1 = very mild: forgets once \n2 = mild: must\
    \ be reminded 2 times \n3 = moderate: must be reminded 3 or 4 times \n4 = moderately\
    \ severe: must be reminded 5 or 6 times \n5 = severe: must be reminded 7 or more\
    \ times \n<span class=\"s53\"><b>Reference</b></span><span class=\"s54\"><b>s</b></span></p>\n\

    <p>Global ratings are intended to provide an index of clinical importance of change\
    \ that cannot be obtained from quantitative assessment measures such as mental\
    \ status examinations. The Video-referenced Clinician's Interview-Based Impression\
    \ of Change (CIBIC+) has been designed to observe the patient's behavior in a\
    \ cumulative global sense (as opposed to rating each behavior for the purpose\
    \ of deriving a scored severity). The majority of the interview appears somewhat\
    \ conversational (except for certain items, for example, those items seeking evidence\
    \ of disturbed praxis) yet it samples behaviors that might be affected by AD.\
    \ The seemingly informal tone of the CIBIC+ interview is designed to reduce the\
    \ discomfort that a patient might feel when placed in a traditional testing environment.\
    \ Since the interview is not scored and it's intent is to elicit standardized\
    \ patient behaviors that will provide the clinician with a global impression of\
    \ change.</p>\n<p><b>Test Administration</b></p>\n<p>A semi-structured interview\

    \ Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI-X)</p>\n<p><b>Background Information</b></p>\n\
    <p>The neuropsychiatric inventory (NPI) (Cummings et al. 1994) was developed to\
    \ assess behavioral disturbances occurring in dementia patients: delusions, hallucinations,\
    \ agitation/aggression, depression/dysphoria, anxiety, elation/euphoria, apathy/indifference,\
    \ disinhibition, irritability/liability, aberrant motor activity, sleep, and appetite\
    \ and eating disorders. The NPI uses a screening strategy to immunize administration,\
    \ examining and scoring only those behavioral domains with positive responses\
    \ to screening questions. Frequency, severity and caregiver distress of each behavior\
    \ are determined.</p>\n<p><b>Test Administration</b></p>\n<p>The NPI should be\
    \ administered by a health care professional trained to do so. Information for\
    \ the inventory may be obtained from the spouse or other person intimately familiar\
    \ with the patients behavior. The NPI is administered at every clinic visit, plus\
    \ twice via the telephone when patients are not required to come to the clinic.</p>\n\
    <p>Questions should be asked exactly as written. Clarification's should be provided\
    \ if the caregiver does not understand the questions. The answers pertain to changes\
    \ in patient's behavior that have appeared since the onset of the illness.</p>\n\
    <p><b>Delusions</b></p>\n<p>Does the patient have beliefs that you know are not\
    \ true? For example, insisting that people are trying to harm him/her. Has he/she\
    \ said that family members are not who they say they are; or that the house is\
    \ not their home? I'm not asking about mere suspiciousness; I am interested if\
    \ the patient is convinced that these things are happening to him/her.</p>\n<p><b>Hallucinations</b></p>\n\
    <p>Does the patient have hallucinations such as false visions or voices? Does\
    \ he/she seem to see, hear or experience things that are not present? By this\
    \ questions we do not mean just mistaken beliefs such as stating that someone\
    \ who has died is still alive: rather we are asking if the patient actually has\
    \ abnormal experiences of sounds, or visions.</p>\n<p><b>Agitation/Aggression</b></p>\n\
    <p>Does the patient does have periods when he/she refuses to cooperate or won't\
    \ let people help him/her? Is he/she hard to handle?</p>\n<p><b>Depression/Dysphoria</b></p>\n\
    <p>Does the patient seem sad or depressed? Does he/she say that he/she feels sad\
    \ or depressed?</p>\n<p><b>Anxiety</b></p>\n<p>Is the patient very nervous, worried,\
    \ or frightened for no apparent reason? Does he/she seem very tense or fidgety?\
    \ Is the patient afraid to be apart from you?</p>\n<p><b>Elation/Euphoria</b></p>\n\
    <p>Does the patient seem too cheerful or too happy for no reason? I don't mean\
    \ the normal happiness that comes from seeing friends, receiving presents, or\
    \ spending time with family members. I am asking if the patient has a persistent\
    \ and abnormally good mood or finds humor where others do not.</p>\n<p><b>Apathy/Indifference</b></p>\n\
    <p>Has the patient lost interest in the world around him/her? Has he/she lost\
    \ interest in doing things or lack motivation for starting new activities? Is\
    \ he/she more difficult to engage in conversation or in doing chores? Is the patient\
    \ apathetic or indifferent?</p>\n<p><b>Disinhibition</b></p>\n<p>Does the patient\
    \ seem to act impulsively without thinking? Does he/she do or say things that\
    \ are not usually done or did in public? Does he/she do things that are embarrassing\
    \ to you or others?</p>\n<p><b>Irritability/Lability</b></p>\n<p>Does the patient\
    \ get irritated and easily disturbed? Are his/her moods very changeable? Is he/she\
    \ abnormally impatient? We do not mean frustration over memory loss or inability\
    \ to perform usual tasks; we are interested to know if the patient has abnormal\
    \ irritability , impatience, or rapid emotional changes different from his/her\
    \ usual self.</p>\n<p><b>Aberrant Motor Behavior</b></p>\n<p>Does the patient\
    \ pace, do things over and over such as opening closets or drawers, or repeatedly\
    \ pick at things or wind string or threads?</p>\n<p><b>Night-time Behaviors</b></p>\n\
    <p>Does the patient have difficulty sleeping (do not count as present if the patient\
    \ simply gets up once or twice per night only to go to the bathroom and falls\
    \ back asleep immediately)? Is he/she up at night? Does he she wander at night,\
    \ get dressed, or disturb your sleep?</p>\n<p><b>Appetite and Eating Disorders</b></p>\n\
    <p>Has he/she had any change in appetite, weight, or eating habits ( count as\
    \ NA if the patient is incapacitated and has to be fed)? Has there been any change\
    \ in type of food he/she prefers?</p>\n<p><b>Frequency:</b></p>\n<p>1. Occasionally\
    \ - less than once per week.</p>\n<p>2. Often - about once per week.</p>\n<p>3.\
    \ Frequently - several times per week but less than every day. \n4. Very Frequently\
    \ - once or more per day. <b>Severity:</b></p>\n<p>1. Mild - delusions present\
    \ but seem harmless and produce little \ndistress in the patient.</p>\n<p>2. Moderate\
    \ - delusions are distressing and disruptive.</p>\n<p>3. Marked - delusions are\
    \ very disruptive and are a major source of \nbehavioral disruption. (If PRN medications\
    \ are prescribed, \ntheir use signals that the delusions are of marked severity.)\
    \ \n<b>Distress: How emotionally distressing do you find this behavior?</b></p>\n\
    <p>0. Not at all</p>\n<p>1. Minimally</p>\n<p>2. Mildly</p>\n<p>3. Moderately</p>\n\
    <p>4. Severely</p>\n<p>5. Very severely or extremely</p>\n<p><b>References</b></p>\n\

    \ for Dementia (DAD) scale quantitatively measures functional abilities in activities\
    \ of daily living (ADL) in individuals with cognitive impairments such as dementia\
    \ of the Alzheimer type (DAT). Basic and instrumental ADLs are examined in relation\
    \ to executive skills to delineate areas of cognitive deficits which may impair\
    \ performance in ADL. The DAD is intended specifically for the assessment of disability\
    \ in community residing individuals with cognitive deficits such as DAT and other\
    \ dementias.</p>\n<p>This measure of functional disability is based on the model\
    \ of health proposed by the World Health Organization (WHO). In accordance with\
    \ this model, functional disability refers to any restriction in the ability to\
    \ perform an activity, a task or a behavior of every day life such as basic self-care\
    \ or instrumental activities.</p>\n<p>Functional disability is measured with the\
    \ DAD scale through the assessment of basic, instrumental, and leisure activities.\
    \ The DAD scale includes:</p>\n<p>Basic activities of daily livin<span class=\"\
    s52\">g</span>: Activities that are important for self-care which are dressing,\
    \ hygiene, continence, and eating.</p>\n<p>Instru<span class=\"s56\">m</span>ental\
    \ activities of daily living: Activities that are important for maintenance in\
    \ a specific environment which are meal preparation, telephoning, housework, taking\
    \ care of finance and correspondence, going on an outing, taking medications,\
    \ and ability to stay safely at home.</p>\n<p>Leisure activitie<span class=\"\
    s52\">s</span>: Activities that are beyond the mean of self maintenance and for\
    \ the purpose of recreation which are assessed in terms of interest that is shown\
    \ towards these activities.</p>\n<p>To understand the cognitive dimensions of\
    \ disabilities in ADL within the DAD scale, the above measured ADLs have been\
    \ further subdivided according to executive functions which have showed regression\
    \ patterns in dementias. These are initiation, planning, and organization, and\
    \ effective performance.</p>\n<p>Initiation consists of the ability to decide\
    \ and/or start an action. This requires spontaneity on the part of the individual\
    \ and must be accomplished at an appropriate moment and place.</p>\n<p>Planning\
    \ and organization consists of the ability to identify the different components\
    \ of a task, to be able to structure them in an appropriate sequence, to elaborate\
    \ a strategy for action, and to be able to prepare the required material</p>\n\
    <p>prior to the action. It also includes the ability to monitor actions during\
    \ the activity which involves problem solving and decision making abilities to\
    \ make appropriate corrections when needed.</p>\n<p>Effective perfor<span class=\"\
    s56\">m</span>ance consists of the ability to complete an action. The quality\
    \ of the performance with regards to whether the task is done in a safe and acceptable\
    \ manner is also an important component.</p>\n<p><span class=\"s50\"><b>Tes</b></span><b>t</b>\

    \ Attachment LZZT.6 \nMini-Mental State Examination (MMSE)</p>\n<p><b>Background\
    \ Information</b></p>\n<p>The MMSE is a brief assessment instrument used to assess\
    \ cognitive function in elderly patients. The MMSE can be used to screen for cognitive\
    \ impairment and as a measurement of cognition over time and with pharmacologic\
    \ treatment. The instrument is divided into 2 sections. The first section measures\
    \ orientation, memory, and attention: the maximum score is 21. The second section\
    \ tests the ability of the patient to name objects, follow verbal and written\
    \ commands, write a sentence, and copy figures: the maximum score is 9. The scoring\
    \ range for the MMSE is 0-30.</p>\n<p>Folstein et al (1975) demonstrated the MMSE\
    \ to be both reliable and valid in a group of elderly subjects: including those\
    \ with dementia, depression with cognitive impairment, depression and \u201Cnormal\u201D\
    \ elderly patients. The validity of the MMSE is demonstrated by a positive correlation\
    \ between the patients' MMSE scores and their scores on both the verbal and performance\
    \ sections of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS). The MMSE has been\
    \ shown to possess sensitivity and specificity in various populations. Although\
    \ the MMSE alone is unable to provide diagnostic information, the data on its\
    \ sensitivity and specificity in cognitively impaired patients demonstrates its\
    \ utility as a screening instrument.</p>\n<p><b>Test Administration</b></p>\n\
    <p>The MMSE should be administered by a health care professional trained in its\
    \ use. The MMSE will be administered at Visit 1 (screening visit). The administration\
    \ item of the MMSE requires no more than 10 to 15 minutes. The interviewer should\
    \ make the patient comfortable and establish rapport. Inform the patient that\
    \ you would like to ask him questions to test his memory and concentration. It\
    \ is important to acknowledge correct responses, and to avoid applying pressure\
    \ when a patient finds an item to be difficult. Patients must score between 10\
    \ and 23 on this scale to be eligible for participation in this study.</p>\n<p>Dialogue\
    \ for the Standardized Administration of the MMSE</p>\n<p>Introduce the test by\
    \ saying: <b>\u201CI would like to ask you some questions to test your memory\
    \ and concentration. Most of the questions will be easy, just follow my instruction.\u201D\
    </b></p>\n<p class=\"p22\"><i>1. Orientation (1 point each)</i></p>\n<p>a.  \u201C\
    What year is it? \u201D</p>\n<p>b.  \u201CWhat season is it? \u201D</p>\n<p>c.\
    \  \u201CWhat is today's date? \u201D</p>\n<p>d.  \u201CWhat day of the week is\
    \ today? \u201D</p>\n<p>e.  \u201CWhat is the month? \u201D</p>\n<p>f.  \u201C\
    What state are we in? \u201D</p>\n<p>g.  \u201CWhat county are we in? \u201D</p>\n\
    <p>h.  \u201CWhat town are we in? \u201D</p>\n<p>i.  \u201CCan you tell me the\
    \ name of this hospital? \u201D</p>\n<p>j.  \u201CWhat floor of the building are\
    \ we on? \u201D</p>\n<p>If the patient answered the above items correctly, indicate\
    \ so by scoring 1 point for each item correctly identified.</p>\n<p class=\"p22\"\
    ><i>2. Registration (3 points)</i></p>\n<p>Say to the patient <b>\u201CNow I'd\
    \ like to test your memory... I'm going to name 3 objects. After I have said them,\
    \ I want you to repeat them. Remember what they are because I'm going to ask you\
    \ to name them again in a few minutes.\u201D</b> Then say the names of the items\
    \ slowly and clearly. After you have said all 3 objects, ask the patient to repeat\
    \ them.</p>\n<p>The first repetition determines the score, but keep saying all\
    \ 3 words (up to 6 trials) until the patient can repeat all 3. One point is given\
    \ for each correct response.</p>\n<p class=\"p22\"><i>3. Attention and Calculation\
    \ (5 points)</i></p>\n<p>Instruct the patient: <b>\u201CBegin with 100 and count\
    \ backwards by 7 and keep subtracting until I tell you to stop.\u201D</b></p>\n\
    <p>Stop after 5 subtractions (93, 86, 79, 72, 65). One point is given for each\
    \ sequential correct response. For example, 93, 86, 77, 72 score = 2; 93, 85,\
    \ 78, 71, 64 score = 1. If the patient cannot or refuses to perform this test,\
    \ ask him to spell the word \u201Cworld\u201D backwards. Score 1 point for each\
    \ letter named in correct order. For example, dlrwo score = 3; drlow = 1.</p>\n\
    <p class=\"p22\"><i>4. Recall (3 points)</i></p>\n<p>Ask the patient if he can\
    \ recall the 3 objects you asked him to remember earlier. Give 1 point for each\
    \ correct response.</p>\n<p class=\"p22\"><i>5. Naming (2 points)</i></p>\n<p>Show\
    \ the patient a wrist watch and ask <b>\u201CWhat is this called? \u201D</b></p>\n\
    <p>Next <b>s</b>how the patient a pencil and ask <b>\u201CWhat is this called?\
    \ \u201D</b></p>\n<p>Score 1 point for each item named correctly.</p>\n<p class=\"\
    p22\"><i>6. Repetition (1 point)</i></p>\n<p>Ask the patient to repeat this phrase\
    \ for you: <b>\u201CNo if ands or buts.\u201D</b> Allow only 1 trial. Score 1\
    \ point if the phrase is repeated correctly.</p>\n<p class=\"p22\"><i>7. Three\
    \ Stage Command (3 points)</i></p>\n<p>Have the patient follow this command, Point\
    \ to a piece of paper which is on top of the desk and say to the patient:</p>\n\
    <p><b>\u201CPlease take that piece of paper in your right han</b><span class=\"\

    \ Reading (1 point)</i></p>\n<p>On a blank piece of paper print the sentence:\
    \ \u201CClose your eyes.\u201D in letters large enough for the patient to see\
    \ clearly. Ask him to read the words on it and do what it says. Score 1 point\
    \ if he actually closes his eyes.</p>\n<p class=\"p22\"><i>9. Writing (1 point)</i></p>\n\
    <p>Give the patient a blank piece of paper and ask him to write a sentence for\
    \ you. Do not dictate a sentence, it has to be written spontaneously. The sentence\
    \ should have a subject and a verb and make sense. Correct grammar and punctuation\
    \ are not necessary.</p>\n<p class=\"p22\"><i>10. Copying (1 point)</i></p>\n\
    <p>Instruct the patient to copy the intersecting pentagons exactly as they are\

    \ of systemic disorders or other brain diseases that in and of themselves could\
    \ account for the progressive deficits in \nmemory and cognition. \nII. \nIII.\
    \ \nIV. \nV. \nVI. \nVII. \nThe diagnosis of PROBABLE Alzheimer's disease is supported\
    \ by:</p>\n<p>\u2022 progressive deterioration of specific cognitive functions\
    \ such as language (aphasia), motor skills (apraxia), and perception \n(agnosia);</p>\n\
    <p>\u2022 impaired activities of daily living and altered patterns of behavior;</p>\n\
    <p>\u2022 family history of similar disorders, particularly if confirmed neuropathologically;\
    \ and</p>\n<p>\u2022 laboratory results of:</p>\n<p>normal lumbar puncture as\
    \ evaluated by standard techniques; \nnormal pattern or nonspecific changes in\
    \ EEG, such as increased slow-wave activity; and \nevidence of cerebral atrophy\
    \ on CT with progression documented by serial observation.</p>\n<p>Other clinical\
    \ features consistent with the diagnosis of PROBABLE Alzheimer's disease, after\
    \ exclusion of causes of dementia other than Alzheimer's disease, include:</p>\n\
    <p>\u2022 plateaus in the course of progression of the illness;</p>\n<p>\u2022\
    \ associated symptoms of depression, insomnia, incontinence, delusions, illusions,\
    \ hallucinations, catastrophic verbal, emotional, \nor physical outbursts, sexual\
    \ disorders, and weight loss;</p>\n<p>\u2022 other neurologic abnormalities in\
    \ some patients, especially with more advanced disease and including motor signs\
    \ such as \nincreased muscle tone, myoclonus, or gait disorder;</p>\n<p>\u2022\
    \ seizures in advanced disease; and</p>\n<p>\u2022 CT normal for age.</p>\n<p>Features\
    \ that make the diagnosis of PROBABLE Alzheimer's disease uncertain or unlikely\

    \ findings such as hemiparesis, sensory loss, visual field deficits, and incoordination\
    \ early in the course of the \nillness; and \n\u2022 seizures or gait disturbances\
    \ at the onset or very early in the course of the illness. Clinical diagnosis\
    \ of POSSIBLE Alzheimer's disease:</p>\n<p>\u2022 may be made on the basis of\
    \ the dementia syndrome, in the absence of other neurologic, psychiatric, or systemic\
    \ disorders \nsufficient to cause dementia, and in the presence of variations\
    \ in the onset, in the presentation, or in the clinical course;</p>\n<p>\u2022\
    \ may be made in the presence of a second systemic or brain disorder sufficient\
    \ to produce dementia, which is not considered to \nbe the cause of the dementia;\
    \ and</p>\n<p>\u2022 should be used in research studies when a single, gradually\
    \ progressive severe cognitive deficit is identified in the absence of \nother\
    \ identifiable cause. \nCriteria for diagnosis of DEFINITE Alzheimer's disease\

    <p>\u2022 histopathologic evidence obtained from a biopsy or autopsy.</p>\n<p>Classification\
