<p>This is a Phase III, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study to assess the efficacy and safety of TCZ in combination with SOC compared with matching placebo in combination with SOC in hospitalized adult patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia.  The Sponsor intends to enroll approximately 450 patients that have been diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia and meet the entry criteria in centers globally.</p>
<p>Patients must be at least 18 years of age with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) infection per WHO criteria, including a positive PCR of any specimen (e.g., respiratory, blood, urine, stool, other bodily fluid).  At the time of enrollment, patients must have SpO2  93% or PaO2/FiO2  300 mmHg despite being on SOC, which may include anti-viral treatment, low dose steroids, and supportive care.</p>
<p>Patients in whom, in the opinion of the treating physician, progression to death is imminent and inevitable within the next 24 hours, irrespective of the provision of treatments, will be excluded from the study.  Patients with active tuberculosis (TB) or suspected active bacterial, fungal, viral, or other infection (besides COVID-19) will be excluded from the study.</p>
<p>Patients will be randomized as soon as possible after screening at a 2:1 ratio to receive blinded treatment of either TCZ or a matching placebo, respectively.  Study treatment must be given in combination with SOC.  The randomization will be stratified by geographic region (North America and Europe) and mechanical ventilation (yes, no).  The proportion of patients who are on a mechanical ventilator at the time of randomization will be capped at no more than 50% of the overall study population.</p>
<p>Patients assigned to the TCZ arm will receive one infusion of TCZ 8 mg/kg, with a maximum dose of 800 mg, and patients assigned to the placebo arm will receive one infusion of placebo, both in addition to SOC.</p>
<p>For both arms, if the clinical signs or symptoms worsen or do not improve (reflected by sustained fever or at least a one-category worsening on the 7-category ordinal scale of clinical status), one additional infusion of blinded treatment of TCZ or placebo can be given, 8–24 hours after the initial infusion.</p>

<p>A Data Monitoring Committee will also evaluate safety according to policies and procedures detailed in a DMC Charter.  Regular safety reviews will begin after approximately 15 patients (10 TCZ, 5 placebo) have been enrolled and reached 14-day follow-up.  Early stopping criteria based on compelling efficacy or an imbalance in adverse events will be detailed in the DMC charter.  The safety interim analyses will also be conducted by a statistical programmer independent from the study management team and will be reviewed by the DMC.  Interactions between the DMC and Sponsor will be carried out as specified in the DMC Charter.</p>
<p>The Data Monitoring Committee may initially consist of Sponsor representatives not involved in any operational aspects of the study before transitioning to a fully independent data monitoring committee (iDMC) when feasible.</p>

<p>CRP = c-reactive protein; CT = computed tomography; ECG = electrocardiogram; eCRF = electronic case report form; NCI CTCAE = National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v.5.0; NEWS2 = National Early Warning Score; PaO2/FiO2 = arterial oxygen partial pressure/fraction of inspired oxygen; PBMCs = peripheral blood mononuclear cells; PK = pharmacokinetic; PRO-CTCAE = NCI Patient-Reported Outcomes Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events; SpO2 = peripheral capillary oxygen saturation.</p>
<p>Note:  On treatment days, all assessments should be performed prior to dosing, unless otherwise specified.</p>
<p>a	Results from standard-of-care tests or examinations performed prior to obtaining informed consent and within 48 hours before randomization may be used; such tests do not need to be repeated for screening.</p>
<p>b	Informed consent must be documented before any study-specific screening procedure is performed.</p>
<p>c	A complete physical examination, performed at screening and per the investigator’s discretion during the study, includes an evaluation of the head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat, and the cardiovascular, dermatologic, musculoskeletal, respiratory, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, and neurologic systems.  Any abnormality identified at screening should be recorded on the General Medical History and Baseline Conditions eCRF. New or worsened clinically significant abnormalities identified during the study should be reported as adverse events.</p>
<p>d   COVID-19 test (SARS-CoV2 PCR) to confirm diagnosis should be performed within 7 days of randomization.</p>
<p>e	Screening chest X-ray or CT scans should be performed within 48 hours prior to randomization.  If additional chest X-rays/CT scans are taken per local practice during the study, this information should be provided in the eCRF.</p>
<p>f	For women of childbearing potential, including those who have had a tubal ligation, positive urine test results will be confirmed with a serum pregnancy test.  Study drug infusion must not be administered unless the serum pregnancy test result is negative.</p>
<p>g	If arterial blood gases are measured.</p>
<p>h	All vital sign measurements (i.e., respiratory rate, pulse rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressures, and body temperature), oxygen saturation and NEWS2-specific assessments (i.e., consciousness and presence or absence of oxygen support) should be recorded together twice daily with approximately 12 hours in between while the patient remains hospitalized.  If measured more than once during a 12-hour period, the worst values (highest temperature, respiratory rate, and heart rate; lowest blood pressure, oxygen saturation, and consciousness level) during that period should be recorded on the eCRF.</p>
<p>i   Assessment of clinical status using the ordinal scale should be recorded at baseline on Day 1/Visit 1 then again daily every morning (between 8 am and 12 pm) for patients who remain hospitalized.</p>
<p>j	After informed consent has been obtained but prior to initiation of study drug, only serious adverse events caused by a protocol-mandated intervention should be reported.  After initiation of study drug, all adverse events will be reported until 60 days after the final dose of study drug.  After this period, the Sponsor should be notified if the investigator becomes aware of any serious adverse event that is believed to be related to prior study drug treatment (see Section 5.6).</p>
<p>k	Medication (e.g., prescription drugs, over-the-counter drugs, vaccines, herbal or homeopathic remedies, nutritional supplements) used by a patient in addition to protocol-mandated treatment from 7 days prior to initiation of study drug to the study completion/discontinuation visit.</p>
<p>l	Hematology includes WBC count, RBC count, hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelet count, differential count (neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils, monocytes, lymphocytes), and lymphocyte subsets (T cells, B cells, and NK cells; if the test is available at the site).</p>
<p>m	Chemistry panel (serum or plasma) includes bicarbonate or total carbon dioxide (if considered standard of care for the region), sodium, potassium, chloride, glucose, BUN or urea, creatinine, total protein, albumin, phosphorus, calcium, total bilirubin, ALP, ALT, and/or AST, uric acid, LDH, ferritin, and D-dimer.</p>
<p>n	Study drug should be administered after collection of all samples for pharmacodynamic and exploratory biomarker analyses.  The initial study drug infusion should be given within 4 hours of randomization.  If the clinical signs or symptoms worsen or do not improve (reflected by sustained fever or at least a one-category worsening on the 7-category ordinal scale of clinical status), one additional infusion of blinded treatment of TCZ or placebo can be given, 8–24 hours after the initial infusion.</p>
<p>o	On Day 1, CRP, IL-6, and sIL-6R samples should be drawn 0-4 hours before the start of infusion and then within 15 minutes (to 1 hour) after the end of the infusion, on the opposite arm as the infusion.  Patents receiving a second infusion of study drug should provide extra samples for CRP, IL-6, and sIL-6R prior to and 15 minutes after the end of the infusion, on the opposite arm as the infusion.</p>
<p>p	Patents receiving a second infusion of study drug should provide an extra PK sample prior to and 15 minutes (to 1 hour) after the end of the infusion, on the opposite arm as the infusion.</p>
<p>q	On Day 1, PK samples should be drawn 0-4 hours before the start of infusion and then within 15 minutes (to 1 hour) after the end of the infusion, on the opposite arm as the infusion.</p>
<p>r	Viral load will be assessed by nasopharyngeal swab.  Patients who are intubated and undergo bronchoalveolar lavage will have samples taken for virological assessment.  It may only be possible to access one nostril if a patient has a nasogastric tube in place, in which case sites may collect a sample from one nostril only and where possible the same nostril should be used.</p>
<p>s	For sites capable of sample collection for analysis of T cells by high-dimensional cytometry.</p>
<p>t	The first draw of blood should not be for PAXgeneâ tubes to avoid contact with RNA preservation reagent inside the tube.</p>

They are a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS CoV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV).</p>
<p>COVID-19, which is the acronym of “coronavirus disease 2019,” is caused by a novel coronavirus strain (SARS-CoV-2) and was newly named on 11 February 2020 by the World Health Organization (WHO).  An epidemic of cases with unexplained lower respiratory tract infections was first detected in Wuhan, the largest metropolitan area in China’s Hubei province, and was reported to the WHO Country Office in China on December 31, 2019.  A pandemic was subsequently declared by the WHO on 11 March 2020.</p>
<p>According to the WHO, as of 12 April 2020 over 1,600,000 cases of COVID-19 were reported in over 200 countries and territories worldwide, with over 105,000 deaths (WHO 2020a).  Up to ~20% of infected patients experienced complications related to a severe form of interstitial pneumonia, which may progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and/or multi organ failure (MOF) and death (WHO 2020b).</p>
<p>To date, there is no vaccine and no specific antiviral medicine shown to be effective in preventing or treating COVID-19.  Most patients with mild cases of disease recover with symptomatic treatment and supportive care.  However, patients with more severe illness frequently require hospitalization (WHO 2020b).</p></div></div><div class=""><h3 id="section-2.1.2">2.1.2 Background on Tocilizumab</h3><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Tocilizumab (TCZ) is a recombinant humanized, anti-human monoclonal antibody of the IgG1 subclass directed against soluble and membrane-bound IL-6R.  TCZ binds specifically to both soluble IL-6R (sIL-6R) and membrane-bound IL-6R and has been shown to inhibit both soluble and membrane-bound IL-6Rmediated signaling.  IL-6 is a pleiotropic pro inflammatory multifunctional cytokine produced by a variety of cell types and has been shown to be involved in diverse physiological processes such as T-cell activation; induction of acute phase proteins; stimulation of hematopoietic precursor cell growth and differentiation; proliferation of hepatic, dermal, and neural cells; bone metabolism; lipid metabolism; hepatoprotection; and fibrosis.  Elevated tissue and serum levels of IL-6 have been implicated in the disease pathology of several inflammatory and autoimmune disorders including rheumatoid arthritis (RA), Castleman disease, systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (sJIA), polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (pJIA), giant cell arteritis (GCA), Takayasu arteritis (TAK), systemic sclerosis (SSc), and cytokine-release syndrome (CRS).  Inhibition of the biological activity of IL-6 or IL-6R has been effective in the treatment of these disorders, including chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell induced CRS, for which treatment with TCZ has been approved in many countries.</p>
<p>TCZ has IV and SC formulations.  Some of the above-listed indications (RA, sJIA, and pJIA) have received approval for both the IV and SC formulations, whereas others have received approval exclusively for the IV (Castleman disease and CRS) or the SC (GCA and TAK) formulation.</p>
<p>The estimated cumulative clinical trial exposure to tocilizumab from the DIBD (28 April 1997) and until 10 April 2019 (DLP for PBRER) is 24,826 patients (40154.98 patient years [PY]).  Since the IBD (11 April 2005), the estimated cumulative market exposure to tocilizumab until 10 April 2019 is 1,301,050 patients (1,053,779 PY).  The combined cumulative post-marketing exposure of patients to IV tocilizumab is estimated to be 896,672 patients (726,347 PY).  The combined cumulative postmarketing exposure of patients to SC tocilizumab is 404,378 (327,432 PY).</p>
<p>Refer to the Tocilizumab Investigator's Brochure for details on nonclinical and clinical studies.</p></div></div><div class=""><h3 id="section-2.1.3">2.1.3 Tocilizumab Treatment in Cytokine-Release Syndrome of CAR-T Therapy</h3><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>CRS has been identified as a clinically significant, on-target, off-tumor side effect of the CAR T-cell therapies used for treatment of malignancies.  Characteristics of CRS include fever, fatigue, headache, encephalopathy, hypotension, tachycardia, coagulopathy, nausea, capillary leak, and multi-organ dysfunction.  The reported incidence of CRS after CAR T-cell therapy ranges from 50% to 100%, with 13% to 48% of patients experiencing the severe or life-threatening form.  Serum levels of inflammatory cytokines are elevated, particularly interleukin-6 (IL-6).  The severity of symptoms may correlate with the serum cytokine concentrations and the duration of exposure to the inflammatory cytokines.</p>
<p>On August 30, 2017, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved tocilizumab (Actemra) for the treatment of severe or life-threatening CAR T cell-induced CRS in adults and in pediatric patients 2 years of age and older.  The approved dose is 8 mg/kg for body weight  30kg and 12 mg/kg for body weight  30 kg.  Up to three additional doses may be given if no improvement of sign/symptoms, and the interval between the subsequent doses should be at least 8 hours.</p>
<p>The approval of TCZ was based on a retrospective analysis of data for patients treated with TCZ who developed CRS after treatment with tisagenlecleucel (Kymriah) or axicabtagene ciloleucel (Yescarta) in prospective clinical trials, (Le et al. 2018).  Thirty-one out of the 45 patients (69%) from the CTL019 series achieved a response (defined as being afebrile and off vasopressors for at least 24 hours within 14 days of the first dose of TCZ (maximum up to two doses) and without use of additional treatment other than corticosteroids) within 14 days of the first dose of TCZ, and the median time from the first dose to response was 4 days.  Eight of the 15 patients (53%) from the axicabtagene ciloleucel series achieved a response, and the median time to response was 4.5 days.  The response rates were largely consistent among subgroups such as age group, sex, race, ethnicity, grade of CRS at first dose of TCZ, and duration of CRS prior to treatment with TCZ.  There were no reports of adverse reactions attributable to TCZ.</p>
<p>Pharmacokinetic (PK) data were available for 27 patients after the first dose of TCZ and for 8 patients after a second dose of TCZ.  Based on 131 PK observations, the geometric mean (% CV) maximum concentration of TCZ in the patients with CAR T cell induced, severe or life-threatening CRS was 99.5 g/mL (36.8%) after the first infusion and 160.7 g/mL (113.8%) after the second infusion.  The PK modeling analysis showed that patients with CRS had a faster clearance of TCZ than healthy volunteers and other patient populations, and simulations showed that exposure was considered acceptable with up to four doses of TCZ at least 8 hours apart in patients with CRS.</p>
<p>TCZ is also approved for CAR-T induced severe or life-threatening CRS in the European Union and certain other countries.</p></div></div><div class=""><h3 id="section-2.1.4">2.1.4 Real World Experience With Tocilizumab in COVID-19 Pneumonia</h3><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Physicians in China initiated the off-label use of TCZ in the treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia.  Based on the results of an initial 21-patient retrospective study in which patients with severe or critical COVID-19 pneumonia were treated with TCZ (Xu et al. 2020), an investigator-sponsored randomized, controlled trial (n = 188) has been initiated in the same population in China, testing the same TCZ dose regimen and is currently ongoing, with approximately 70 patients enrolled.  At present, the 21-patient publication (Xu et al. 2020) is the only published clinical data the Sponsor is aware of regarding the use of TCZ in the treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia.</p>
<p>On 3 March 2020, TCZ was included in the seventh updated diagnosis and treatment plan for COVID-19 issued by the China National Health Commission as one treatment option for severe or critical forms of COVID-19 pneumonia.  The Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention defined disease severity according to the following criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li>•	Severe disease: dyspnea, respiratory frequency  30/min, blood oxygen saturation (SpO2)  93%, PaO2/FiO2 ratio (the ratio between the blood pressure of the oxygen [partial pressure of oxygen, PaO2] and the percentage of oxygen supplied [fraction of inspired oxygen, FiO2])  300 mmHg, and/or lung infiltrates  50% within 24 to 48 hours; this occurred in 14% of cases.</li>
<li>•	Critical disease: respiratory failure, septic shock, and/or multiple organ dysfunction (MOD) or failure (MOF); this occurred in 5% of cases (Wu et al. 2020).  </li>
</ul>
<p>Because body weight measurement is not always feasible in urgent circumstances, the dose regimen used in China is a single fixed dose of 400 mg TCZ IV (which equates to between 48 mg/kg based on the body weight range of the Chinese adult population), with the maximum single dose no more than 800 mg.  If clinical signs/symptoms do not improve, an additional dose can be administered after 12 hours.  The guidance advises that no more than two doses should be given.  TCZ treatment is not permitted for people with active infections including TB, bacterial, or fungal.</p></div></div><div class=""><h3 id="section-2.1.5">2.1.5 Results from 21 Patients Treated with Tocilizumab in China</h3><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>In February 2020, twenty-one patients with severe or critical COVID-19 pneumonia were treated with TCZ IV (400 mg) plus standard of care.  The average age of the patients was 56.8  16.5 years, ranging from 25 to 88 years.  Seventeen patients (81.0%) were assessed as severe and four (19.0%) as critical.  Most patients (85%) presented with lymphopenia.  C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were increased in all 20 patients (mean, 75.06  66.80 mg/L).  The median procalcitonin (PCT) value was 0.33  0.78 ng/mL, and only two of 20 patients (10.0%) presented with an abnormal value.  Mean IL-6 level before TCZ was 132.38  278.54 pg/mL (normal  7 pg/mL).</p>
<p>Standard of care consisted of lopinavir, methylprednisolone, other symptom relievers, and oxygen therapy as recommended by the Diagnosis and Treatment Protocol for Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia (Sixth Edition).  All 21 patients had received routine standard of care treatment for a week before deteriorating with sustained fever, hypoxemia, and chest CT image worsening.</p>
<p>Eighteen patients (85.7%) received TCZ once, and three patients (14.3%) had a second dose due to fever within 12 hours.  According to the authors, after TCZ treatment, fever returned to normal and all other symptoms improved remarkably.  Fifteen of the 20 patients (75.0%) had lowered their oxygen intake and one patient needed no oxygen therapy.  CT scans showed significant remission of opacities in both lungs in 19/20 patients (90.5%) after treatment with TCZ.  The percentage of lymphocytes in peripheral blood, which was decreased in 85.0% of patients (17/20) before treatment (mean, 15.52  8.89%), returned to normal in 52.6% of patients (10/19) on the fifth day after treatment.  Abnormally elevated CRP decreased significantly in 84.2% patients (16/19).  No adverse drug reactions and no subsequent pulmonary infections were reported.</p>
<p>Nineteen patients (90.5%) were discharged at the time of the report, including two critical patients.  There were no deaths among the 21 treated patients.</p>
<p>The study authors concluded that TCZ is an effective treatment for patients with severe COVID-19 (Xu et al. 2020).</p>

Optional level 3 subheadings are provided to assist with organization of the section; alternatively, the section may be summarized in a single section utilizing the overall benefit-risk entry point.</p>
<p></p></div></div><div class=""><h3 id="section-2.2.1">2.2.1 Benefits Summary</h3><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>There are currently no drugs licensed for the treatment of patients with COVID-19.  Given the results of studies outlined above, TCZ, along with standard of care (SOC) treatment, could provide efficacy, offering the potential to treat COVID-19 in hospitalized populations more effectively than current SOC alone.  Extensive safety data have previously been generated on the use of TCZ in other indications.  Therefore, a placebo-controlled study in combination with SOC to assess safety and efficacy of TCZ in hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia is justified to address the high unmet need and burden of disease in this severely ill population.</p>
<p></p></div></div><div class=""><h3 id="section-2.2.2">2.2.2 Risk Summary and Mitigation Strategy</h3><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>This section highlights the main risks for this study population and following 12 doses of TCZ.  For a complete list of all identified or potential risks of TCZ therapy, please refer to the current version of the TCZ Investigator’s Brochure.</p>
<p>Hypersensitivity Reactions, Including Anaphylaxis</p>
<p>An infusion reaction is defined as any adverse event that occurs during or within 24 hours after the infusion.  This may include hypersensitivity or anaphylactic reactions.  Stevens-Johnson syndrome has been reported during treatment with TCZ in the post marketing setting.  Signs of a possible hypersensitivity reaction include, but are not limited to, the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>•	Fever, chills, pruritus, urticaria, angioedema, and skin rash</li>
<li>•	Cardiopulmonary reactions, including chest pain, dyspnea, hypotension, or hypertension</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>TCZ infusions will be administered to patients at the site under close supervision.  Health care professionals administering TCZ infusions should be trained in the appropriate procedures for TCZ administration, should be able to recognize the symptoms associated with potential hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, and should have the appropriate medication available for immediate use in case of hypersensitivity reaction such as anaphylaxis during or after administration of TCZ.  The patient should be treated according to the standard of care for management of the hypersensitivity reaction.</p>
<p>If a patient has symptoms of serious hypersensitivity reactions, such as anaphylaxis, or requires an interruption of the study drug because of symptoms of hypersensitivity including anaphylaxis, administration of TCZ must be discontinued permanently.</p>
<p>Serious Infections and Opportunistic Infections</p>
<p>Physicians should exercise caution when considering the use of TCZ in patients with increased risk of infection, such as a history of recurring infections or with underlying conditions (e.g., diabetes mellitus) which may predispose patients to serious infections and opportunistic infections such as TB and viral reactivations (e.g., hepatitis B virus).</p>
<p>Vigilance for timely detection of serious infection is recommended for patients receiving biologic agents, as signs and symptoms of acute inflammation may be lessened because of suppression of the acute-phase reaction.  The effects of TCZ on CRP and neutrophils, and the signs and symptoms of infection, should be considered when evaluating a patient for a potential infection.  It is recommended that neutropenic patients (ANC  1000/L) undergo weekly surveillance blood cultures during the study.</p>
<p>If a patient develops a serious infection, administration of TCZ should be discontinued.</p>
<p>Gastrointestinal Perforations</p>
<p>Symptomatic diverticulosis, diverticulitis, or chronic ulcerative lower GI disease, such as Crohn disease, ulcerative colitis, or other chronic lower GI conditions, might predispose patients to GI perforations.  Timely diagnosis and appropriate treatment may reduce the potential for complications of diverticular disease and thus reduce the risk of GI perforations.</p>
<p>Discontinuation of TCZ is required for patients who develop GI perforations.</p>
<p>Hematologic Abnormalities</p>
<p>Decreases in neutrophil counts, platelet counts, and fibrinogen levels have been observed following treatment with TCZ for labelled indications.  Treatment-related neutropenia was not associated with serious infection in clinical trials in any indication and no association between decreases in platelet counts and serious bleeding events has been observed.</p>
<p>Demyelinating Disorders</p>
<p>The effect of treatment with TCZ on demyelinating disorders is not known; events have been reported rarely.  Physicians should exercise caution when considering the use of TCZ in patients with preexisting or recent-onset demyelinating disorders.</p>
<p>Patients should be closely monitored for signs and symptoms potentially indicative of central demyelinating disorders.</p>
<p>Elevated Liver Enzymes</p>
<p>In clinical trials, mild and moderate elevations of hepatic transaminases have been observed with TCZ treatment.</p>
<p>Recommended TCZ dose modifications for elevated liver enzymes in these populations are not applicable to this study due to single dose therapy (with possible additional infusion) with TCZ or placebo.</p>
<p>Patients who develop elevated liver function tests during the study must have repeat tests performed as clinically indicated until levels return to baseline, even if they withdraw from the study.  If the specialist deems a liver biopsy necessary, the prepared histologic slides will be requested by the Sponsor for central review by a third party, and the biopsy report should be forwarded to the Sponsor.</p>
<p>CYP450 Enzyme Normalization</p>
<p>The expression of hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzymes is suppressed by cytokines, such as IL-6, that stimulate chronic inflammation.  TCZ normalizes expression of these enzymes.  The effect of TCZ on CYP450 enzymes (except CYP2C19 and CYP2D6) is clinically relevant for CYP450 substrates with a narrow therapeutic index and/or when the dose is individually adjusted.</p>
<p>When starting or stopping therapy with TCZ, patients taking medicinal products which are individually dose adjusted and are metabolized via CYP450 CYP3A4, CYP1A2, CYP2B6, or CYP2C9 (e.g., atorvastatin, calcium-channel blockers, theophylline, warfarin, phenprocoumon, phenytoin, cyclosporine, or benzodiazepines) should be monitored as doses of these products may need to be adjusted to maintain their therapeutic effect.</p>

The Sponsor intends to enroll approximately 450 patients that have been diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia and meet the entry criteria in centers globally.</p>
<p>Patients must be at least 18 years of age with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) infection per WHO criteria, including a positive PCR of any specimen (e.g., respiratory, blood, urine, stool, other bodily fluid).  At the time of enrollment, patients must have SpO2  93% or PaO2/FiO2  300 mmHg despite being on SOC, which may include anti-viral treatment, low dose steroids, and supportive care.</p>
<p>Patients in whom, in the opinion of the treating physician, progression to death is imminent and inevitable within the next 24 hours, irrespective of the provision of treatments, will be excluded from the study.  Patients with active tuberculosis (TB) or suspected active bacterial, fungal, viral, or other infection (besides COVID-19) will be excluded from the study.</p>
<p>Patients will be randomized as soon as possible after screening at a 2:1 ratio to receive blinded treatment of either TCZ or a matching placebo, respectively.  Study treatment must be given in combination with SOC.  The randomization will be stratified by geographic region (North America and Europe) and mechanical ventilation (yes, no).  The proportion of patients who are on a mechanical ventilator at the time of randomization will be capped at no more than 50% of the overall study population.</p>
<p>Patients assigned to the TCZ arm will receive one infusion of TCZ 8 mg/kg, with a maximum dose of 800 mg, and patients assigned to the placebo arm will receive one infusion of placebo (see Section 4.3), both in addition to SOC.</p>
<p>For both arms, if the clinical signs or symptoms worsen or do not improve (reflected by sustained fever or at least a one-category worsening on the 7-category ordinal scale of clinical status; see Section 4.5.10), one additional infusion of blinded treatment of TCZ or placebo can be given, 8–24 hours after the initial infusion.</p>
<p>Patients who do not meet the criteria for participation in this study (screen failure) may qualify for one re-screening opportunity (for a total of 2 screenings per participant) at the investigator’s discretion.  Patients are not required to re-sign the consent form if they are re-screened within 7 days after previously signing the consent form.  The investigator will record the reasons for screen failure in the screening log in Section 4.5.1.</p>
<p>The study assessments to be conducted include the following: physical examination, vital signs, oxygen saturation, assessment of consciousness, presence and absence of respiratory support, adverse events, concomitant therapies, clinical laboratory tests, and nasopharyngeal swabs.  Please see Appendix 1, Appendix 2, and Appendix 3 for details concerning the timing of these assessments.</p>
<p>Patients will be followed up for a total of 60 days after first dose of study medication.</p>
<p>If patients are discharged from hospital prior to Day 28, follow up visits should occur twice weekly through Day 28.  Patients are encouraged to return for onsite visits at least weekly if possible; other follow-up visits may be conducted by telephone or home visits.  Patients should return to the site for a Day 28 visit.  After Day 28, all patients should have follow up visits on Day 35, Day 45, and Day 60; the Day 35 and Day 45 visits may be conducted by telephone or by home visits for discharged patients, while the Day 60 visit should be conducted onsite.</p>
<p>During the study, standard supportive care will be given according to clinical practice.</p>

Given the results of studies outlined above, TCZ, along with standard of care (SOC) treatment, could provide efficacy, offering the potential to treat COVID-19 in hospitalized populations more effectively than current SOC alone.  Extensive safety data have previously been generated on the use of TCZ in other indications.  Therefore, a placebo-controlled study in combination with SOC to assess safety and efficacy of TCZ in hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia is justified to address the high unmet need and burden of disease in this severely ill population.</p>
<p></p></div></div><div class=""><h3 id="section-4.2.2">4.2.2 Rationale for Duration</h3><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Patients will be followed-up for a period of 60 days from randomization.  This period is supported by historical data from studies performed in healthy subjects and patients with RA (study LRO300 and LRO301) where the mean apparent half-life was determined by non-compartmental analysis and ranged from 7 to 8 days following a single dose of 10 mg/kg IV or multiple doses of 8 mg/kg IV Q4W.  Moreover, modeling of free sIL6R levels over time, as the principal marker of target engagement, showed that soluble receptors returned to their maximum level after 4 weeks following a single administration of 8 mg/kg IV, demonstrating the absence of drug binding and therefore of drug effect after 4 weeks (Gibiansky and Frey 2012).</p>
<p></p></div></div><div class=""><h3 id="section-4.2.3">4.2.3 Rationale for Control Type</h3><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>The study will compare the efficacy and safety of TCZ IV compared with matching placebo in combination with SOC.  Despite the lack of targeted treatments for COVID-19, SOC for patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia generally includes supportive care and may include available anti-viral agents and low-dose corticosteroids as dictated by local treatment guidelines.  Therefore, SOC plus placebo treatment is appropriate as a control in this study.</p>
<p></p></div></div><div class=""><h3 id="section-4.2.4">4.2.4 Rationale for Other Trial Design Aspects</h3><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"></div></div><div class=""><h4 id="section-4.2.4.1">4.2.4.1 Rationale for Biomarker Assessments</h4><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>COVID-19 infection is a heterogeneous disease, and patients with severe COVID-19 have shown various levels of IL-6 pathway activation (Xu et al. 2020).  Therefore, all patients may not be equally likely to benefit from treatment with TCZ.  Pharmacodynamic biomarkers will be assessed to demonstrate evidence of biologic activity of TCZ in patients, to support selection of a recommended dose and dosing regimen, and to inform potential revisions to the PK sample collection schedule.  The exploratory biomarkers will be assessed to identify those patients who are most likely to respond to TCZ, to characterize TCZ mechanism of action, to provide further evidence of TCZ efficacy, and to understand progression of COVID-19.</p>
<p></p></div></div><div class=""><h2 id="section-4.3">4.3 Trial Stopping Rules</h2><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Not applicable.</p>
<p></p></div></div><div class=""><h2 id="section-4.4">4.4 Start of Trial and End of Trial</h2><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>The end of this study is defined as the date when the last patient, last visit (LPLV) occurs or the date at which the last data point required for last follow-up is received from the last patient, whichever occurs later.  The end of the study is expected to occur approximately 2 months after the last patient is enrolled.</p>
<p>In addition, the Sponsor may decide to terminate the study at any time.</p>
<p>The total length of the study, from screening of the first patient to the end of the study, is expected to be approximately 6 months.</p>
<p>Patients with evidence of lung fibrosis will be referred to their regular healthcare provider for further follow up.</p>
<p></p></div></div><div class=""><h2 id="section-4.5">4.5 Access to Trial Intervention After End of Trial</h2><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Since the TCZ treatment is not intended for continued therapy, the Sponsor does not have any plans to provide Roche TCZ or any other study treatments to patients who have completed the study.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The Roche Global Policy on Continued Access to Investigational Medicinal Product is available at the following website:</p>

<p></p></div></div><div class="page"><h1 id="section-5">5 Trial Population</h1><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p></p></div></div><div class=""><h2 id="section-5.1">5.1 Description of Trial Population and Rationale</h2><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Based on the current knowledge of COVID-19, approximately 80% of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) experience mild disease and can recover at home and require only simple symptomatic relief.  However, approximately 20% require hospitalization due to more severe disease.  A study of 138 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 published on 7 February 2020 found that 26% of patients admitted to hospital required transfer to the intensive care unit (ICU) and 4.3% died; however, given that a number of patients were still hospitalized at the time of this report, this number may be an underestimate (Wang et al. 2020).  A previous study had found that out of 41 admitted hospital patients, 13 (32%) were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died (Huang et al. 2020).  A more recent study with 1099 patients indicated that 16% of patients developed a severe form of disease, 5% were admitted to an ICU, 2.3% underwent invasive mechanical ventilation, and 1.4% died (Guan et al. 2020).</p>
<p>Given the significant unmet need in patients hospitalized with severe COVID-19, and based on the emerging evidence for TCZ use in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, this study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of TCZ in this population.  Morbidity and mortality are particularly high for elderly patients and those with comorbidities.  This study will include both these groups, with no upper age limit.</p>
<p></p></div></div><div class=""><h2 id="section-5.2">5.2 Inclusion Criteria</h2><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Patients must meet the following criteria for study entry:</p>

<li>•	Ability to comply with the study protocol, in the investigator's judgment</li>
<li>•	Hospitalized with COVID-19 pneumonia confirmed per a positive PCR of any specimen (e.g., respiratory, blood, urine, stool, other bodily fluid) and evidenced by chest X-ray or CT scan </li>
<li>•	SpO2  93% or PaO2/FiO2  300 mmHg</li>
</ul>
<p>If a patient is on supplemental oxygen with SpO2  93%, but desaturation to  93% on lower supplemental oxygen or ambient air is documented during screening, the inclusion criterion is met.</p>
<ul>
<li>•	For women of childbearing potential:  agreement to remain abstinent (refrain from heterosexual intercourse) or use contraception, as defined below:</li>
</ul>
<p>Women must remain abstinent or use contraceptive methods with a failure rate of 1% per year during the treatment period and for 90 days after the final dose of study drug.  Women must refrain from donating eggs during this same period.</p>
<p>A woman is considered to be of childbearing potential if she is postmenarchal, has not reached a postmenopausal state ( 12 continuous months of amenorrhea with no identified cause other than menopause), and is not permanently infertile due to surgery (i.e., removal of ovaries, fallopian tubes, and/or uterus) or another cause as determined by the investigator (e.g., Müllerian agenesis).  The definition of childbearing potential may be adapted for alignment with local guidelines or regulations.</p>
<p>Examples of contraceptive methods with a failure rate of  1% per year include bilateral tubal ligation, male sterilization, hormonal contraceptives that inhibit ovulation, hormone-releasing intrauterine devices, and copper intrauterine devices.</p>
<p>The reliability of sexual abstinence should be evaluated in relation to the duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient.  Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not adequate methods of contraception.  If required per local guidelines or regulations, locally recognized adequate methods of contraception and information about the reliability of abstinence will be described in the local Informed Consent Form.</p>
<ul>
<li>•	For men:  agreement to remain abstinent (refrain from heterosexual intercourse) or use a condom, and agreement to refrain from donating sperm, as defined below:</li>
</ul>
<p>With a female partner of childbearing potential or pregnant female partner, men must remain abstinent or use a condom during the treatment period and for 60 days after the final dose of study drug to avoid exposing the embryo.  Men must refrain from donating sperm during this same period.</p>
<p>The reliability of sexual abstinence should be evaluated in relation to the duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient.

If the clinical signs or symptoms worsen or do not improve (reflected by sustained fever or at least a one-category worsening on the 7-category ordinal scale of clinical status), one additional infusion of TCZ 8 mg/kg IV can be given, 8–24 hours after the initial infusion.</p>
<p>The TCZ dose regimen chosen in this study for adult patients is consistent with the approved TCZ dose for patients experiencing CRS induced by CAR-T cell therapy who weigh  30 kg.  Further, based on the off-label experience from China (one additional dose if fever is not improved within 12 hours) and the fact that up to three additional infusions of TCZ (with at least 8 hours in between infusions) are allowed for CAR-T induced CRS, the proposed additional one infusion if clinical signs/symptoms worsen or do not improve is justified.</p>
<p>Patients will be followed-up for a period of 60 days from randomization.  This period is supported by historical data from studies performed in healthy subjects and patients with RA (study LRO300 and LRO301) where the mean apparent half-life was determined by non-compartmental analysis and ranged from 7 to 8 days following a single dose of 10 mg/kg IV or multiple doses of 8 mg/kg IV Q4W.  Moreover, modeling of free sIL6R levels over time, as the principal marker of target engagement, showed that soluble receptors returned to their maximum level after 4 weeks following a single administration of 8 mg/kg IV, demonstrating the absence of drug binding and therefore of drug effect after 4 weeks (Gibiansky and Frey 2012).</p>

The infusion bag of TCZ/placebo should be diluted to 100 ml infusion bag using aseptic technique.  The fully diluted TCZ/placebo solutions for infusion using 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP may be stored at 2 to 8C (36 to 46F) or at room temperature for up to 24 hours and should be protected from light.</p>
<p>If stored at 2 to 8C (36 to 46F), the infusion bag should be allowed to return to room temperature before administration.  The TCZ will be administered at room temperature by controlled infusion into a vein over a 1-hour period.  In exceptional cases this time may be extended to up to 6 hours.  The infusion speed must be 10 mL/hr for 15 minutes and then increased to 130 mL/hr to complete the dosing in 1 hour.  The entire 100 mL content of the infusion bag must be administered.  A total of 20 mL of normal saline will be administered following the infusion of study medication to flush the remaining study drug through the intravenous set.</p>
<p>The IMP (TCZ/placebo) required for completion of this study will be provided by the Sponsor.  The study site (i.e., investigator or other authorized personnel [e.g., pharmacist) is responsible for maintaining records of IMP delivery to the site, IMP inventory at the site, IMP use by each patient, and disposition or return of unused IMP, thus enabling reconciliation of all IMP received, and for ensuring that patients are provided with doses specified by the protocol.</p>
<p>The study site should follow all instructions included with each shipment of IMP.  The study site will acknowledge receipt of IMPs supplied by the Sponsor using the IxRS to confirm the shipment condition and content.  Any damaged shipments will be replaced.  The investigator or designee must confirm that appropriate temperature conditions have been maintained during transit for all IMPs received and that any discrepancies have been reported and resolved before use of the IMPs.  All IMPs must be stored in a secure, environmentally controlled, and monitored (manual or automated) area in accordance with the labeled storage conditions, with access limited to the investigator and authorized staff.</p>

After initial written informed consent has been obtained, all screening procedures and assessments have been completed, and eligibility has been established for a patient, the study site will obtain the patient's identification number and treatment assignment from an interactive voice or web-based response system (IxRS).</p>
<p></p></div></div><div class=""><h3 id="section-6.8.2">6.8.2 Randomization</h3><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Patients will be randomly assigned to one of two treatment arms:  TCZ in combination with SOC or placebo in combination with SOC.  Randomization will occur in a 2:1 ratio through use of a permuted-block randomization method to ensure a balanced assignment to each treatment arm.  The randomization will be stratified by geographic region (North America and Europe) and mechanical ventilation (yes, no).  The proportion of patients who are on a mechanical ventilator at the time of randomization will be capped at no more than 50% of the overall study population.</p>
<p></p></div></div><div class=""><h3 id="section-6.8.3">6.8.3 Blinding</h3><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Study site personnel and patients will be blinded to treatment assignment during the study.  The Sponsor and its agents will also be blinded to treatment assignment, with the exception of individuals who require access to patient treatment assignments to fulfill their job roles during a clinical trial.  These roles include the unblinding group responsible, clinical supply chain managers, sample handling staff, operational assay group personnel, IxRS service provider, and Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) members.</p>
<p>While PK samples must be collected from patients assigned to the comparator arm to maintain the blinding of treatment assignment, PK results for these patients are generally not needed for the safe conduct or proper interpretation of the study data.  Laboratories responsible for performing study drug PK assays will be unblinded to patient treatment assignments to identify appropriate samples for analysis.  PK samples from patients assigned to the comparator arm will not be analyzed for study drug PK concentration except by request (e.g. to evaluate a possible error in dosing).  In addition, Roche monitors, project statisticians, and the project team will be blinded from PK and PD results (including IL-6, sIL-6R, and CRP) until the primary analysis.  Study centers may be unblinded after the final study results are reported.</p>

The investigator is not required to contact the Medical Monitor prior to breaking the treatment code; however, the treatment code should not be broken except in emergency situations.</p>
<p>As per health authority reporting requirements, the Sponsor's Drug Safety representative will break the treatment code for all serious, unexpected suspected adverse reactions (see Section 5.7) that are considered by the investigator or Sponsor to be related to study drug.  The patient may continue to receive treatment, and the investigator, patient, and Sponsor personnel, with the exception of the Drug Safety representative and personnel who must have access to patient treatment assignments to fulfill their roles (as defined above), will remain blinded to treatment assignment.</p>

<p>Chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine (with or without azithromycin) is permitted as part of local practice.  The recommended maximum dose of chloroquine is 400 mg twice a day.</p>
<p>Clinical management guidelines from WHO recommend against the use of corticosteroids in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.  However, country- and region-specific guidelines recommend considering corticosteroids in some COVID-19 patients.  This protocol allows the use of low-dose steroids as part of local SOC.  If steroids are given, the Sponsor recommends a dose of no more than 1 mg/kg methylprednisolone or equivalent for no more than 5 days.</p>
<p>In general, investigators should manage a patient's care with supportive therapies as clinically indicated, per local standard practice.  Patients who experience infusion associated symptoms may be treated symptomatically with acetaminophen, ibuprofen, diphenhydramine, and/or H2-receptor antagonists (e.g., famotidine, ranitidine), or equivalent medications per local standard practice.  Serious infusion associated events manifested by, for example, dyspnea, hypotension, wheezing, bronchospasm, tachycardia, reduced oxygen saturation, or respiratory distress should be managed with supportive therapies as clinically indicated (e.g., supplemental oxygen and 2-adrenergic agonists).</p>

The ordinal scale categories are as follows:</p>
<p>1.	Discharged (or “ready for discharge” as evidenced by normal body temperature and respiratory rate, and stable oxygen saturation on ambient air or  2L supplemental oxygen)</p>
<p>2.	Non-ICU hospital ward (or “ready for hospital ward”) not requiring supplemental oxygen</p>
<p>3.	Non-ICU hospital ward (or “ready for hospital ward”) requiring supplemental oxygen</p>
<p>4.	ICU or non-ICU hospital ward, requiring non-invasive ventilation or high-flow oxygen</p>
<p>5.	ICU, requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation</p>
<p>6.	ICU, requiring ECMO or mechanical ventilation and additional organ support (e.g., vasopressors, renal replacement therapy)</p>
<p>7.	Death</p>
<p>Patients who are ready to be discharged but are still hospitalized (e.g., due to non medical or administrative reasons) will be assigned an ordinal scale category of 1.  Patients in a non-ICU hospital ward who are eligible for ICU care based on clinical presentation but are awaiting ICU care will be assigned an ordinal scale category of 4.  Patients in an ICU for administrative or non-medical reasons who are ready for a non-ICU hospital ward will be assigned an ordinal scale category of 2 (if not requiring supplemental oxygen), 3 (if requiring supplemental oxygen), or 4 (if requiring non invasive ventilation or high-flow oxygen).</p>
<p>In general, patients with oxygen saturation consistently  90% should be considered for escalation to a higher clinical status category, while patients with oxygen saturation consistently  96% should be considered for de-escalation to a lower category.  Patients on supplemental oxygen should be evaluated at least daily and considered for reduction or discontinuation of oxygen support.  Actual changes in level of support will be at the discretion of the clinician(s) treating the patient based on the patient’s overall condition and may be dictated by other clinical and non-clinical considerations.</p>
<p>Normal body temperature is defined as oral, rectal, axillary, temporal, or tympanic temperature 36.138.0C.  Normal respiratory rate is defined as 1220 breaths per minute.</p>

The important safety risks for TCZ are outlined below.  Please refer to the Tocilizumab Investigator's Brochure for a complete summary of safety information.</p>
<p>Several measures will be taken to ensure the safety of patients participating in this study.  Eligibility criteria have been designed to exclude patients at higher risk for toxicities.  Patients will undergo safety monitoring during the study, including assessment of the nature, frequency, and severity of adverse events.  In addition, guidelines for managing adverse events and laboratory abnormalities, including criteria for dosage modification and treatment interruption or discontinuation, are provided below.</p>

Any abnormality identified at baseline should be recorded on the General Medical History and Baseline Conditions eCRF.</p>
<p>Limited, symptom-directed physical examinations may be performed at unscheduled postbaseline visits as clinically indicated.  Changes from baseline abnormalities should be recorded in patient notes.  New or worsened clinically significant abnormalities should be recorded as adverse events on the Adverse Event eCRF.</p>
<p>In addition, patient body weight will be measured at the timepoints specified in the schedule of activities (see Appendix 1, Appendix 2, and Appendix 3).  If it is not feasible to weigh bed-bound patients, historical body weight may be used.</p>
<p></p></div></div><div class=""><h3 id="section-8.4.2">8.4.2 Vital Signs and Oxygen Saturation</h3><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Vital signs will include measurements of respiratory rate, pulse rate, and systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and body temperature.  Peripheral oxygen saturation should also be measured at the same time as the vitals.  For patients requiring supplemental oxygen, the oxygen flow rate (L/min) and/or fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) should be recorded.</p>
<p>In order to allow assessment of the NEWS2 score (see section 4.5.5), all of the vital sign parameters and oxygen saturation should be recorded together twice per day, with approximately 12 hours in between, for the duration of the hospitalization during the study.  This is to ensure that the measurements reflect the patient’s condition over the entire study day, where possible.  If vital signs or oxygen saturation are measured more than once during a 12-hour period, the worst values (highest temperature, respiratory rate, and heart rate; lowest blood pressure, oxygen saturation, and consciousness level) during that period should be recorded on the eCRF.  Following hospital discharge these parameters should be recorded once at each return visit to the clinic. Vital signs and oxygen saturation will not be recorded if follow-up visits are conducted by telephone.</p>

<p>Exploratory biomarker research may include, but will not be limited to, analysis of inflammatory mediators and/or cytokines, ARDS-related variables, serum viral load, and virus resistance/mutation analysis.</p>
<p>In countries where acceptable, research may involve extraction of DNA, cell-free DNA, or RNA; analysis of mutations, single nucleotide polymorphisms, and other genomic variants; and genomic profiling through use of next generation sequencing (NGS) of a comprehensive panel of genes.</p>
<p>For sampling procedures, storage conditions, and shipment instructions, see the laboratory manual.</p>
<p>Biological samples will be destroyed no later than the time of completion of the final Clinical Study Report, with the following exceptions:</p>
<ul>
<li>•	Serum samples collected for PK analysis may be needed for additional PK assay development and validation, and biomarker research; therefore, these samples will be destroyed no later than 15 years after the final Clinical Study Report has been completed.</li>
<li>•	Blood (serum, plasma, PBMCs), blood PAXgene RNA, and tissue-derived samples (nasopharyngeal swabs and BAL, if applicable) collected for pharmacodynamic analysis and biomarker research will be destroyed no later than 15 years after the final Clinical Study Report has been completed</li>

An adverse event can therefore be any of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>•	Any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product</li>
<li>•	Any new disease or exacerbation of an existing disease (a worsening in the character, frequency, or severity of a known condition) (see Sections 5.3.5.9 and 5.3.5.10 for more information)</li>
<li>•	Recurrence of an intermittent medical condition (e.g., headache) not present at baseline</li>
<li>•	Any deterioration in a laboratory value or other clinical test (e.g., ECG, X-ray) that is associated with symptoms or leads to a change in study treatment or concomitant treatment or discontinuation from study drug</li>
<li>•	Adverse events that are related to a protocol-mandated intervention, including those that occur prior to assignment of study treatment (e.g., screening invasive procedures such as biopsies)</li>
</ul>
<p></p></div></div><div class=""><h3 id="section-9.1.2">9.1.2 Definitions of Serious Adverse Events</h3><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>A serious adverse event is any adverse event that meets any of the following criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li>•	Is fatal (i.e., the adverse event actually causes or leads to death)</li>
<li>•	Is life threatening (i.e., the adverse event, in the view of the investigator, places the patient at immediate risk of death)</li>
</ul>
<p>This does not include any adverse event that, had it occurred in a more severe form or was allowed to continue, might have caused death.</p>
<ul>
<li>•	Requires or prolongs inpatient hospitalization (see Section 5.3.5.10)</li>
<li>•	Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (i.e., the adverse event results in substantial disruption of the patient's ability to conduct normal life functions)</li>
<li>•	Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect in a neonate/infant born to a mother exposed to study drug</li>
<li>•	Is a significant medical event in the investigator's judgment (e.g., may jeopardize the patient or may require medical/surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above)</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>The terms "severe" and "serious" are not synonymous.  Severity refers to the intensity of an adverse event (e.g., rated as mild, moderate, or severe, or according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [NCI CTCAE]; see Section 5.3.3); the event itself may be of relatively minor medical significance (such as severe headache without any further findings).</p>
<p>Severity and seriousness need to be independently assessed for each adverse event recorded on the eCRF.</p>
<p>Serious adverse events are required to be reported by the investigator to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event; see Section 5.4.2 for reporting instructions).</p>
<p></p></div></div><div class=""><h2 id="section-9.2">9.2 Timing and Mechanism for Collection and Reporting</h2><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Investigators will seek information on adverse events at each patient contact.  All adverse events, whether reported by the patient or noted by study personnel, will be recorded in the patient's medical record and on the Adverse Event eCRF.</p>
<p>After informed consent has been obtained but prior to initiation of study drug, only serious adverse events caused by a protocol-mandated intervention (e.g., invasive procedures such as biopsies, discontinuation of medications) should be reported (see Section 5.4.2 for instructions for reporting serious adverse events).</p>
<p>After initiation of study drug, all adverse events will be reported during the 60-day follow-up period.</p>
<p>Instructions for reporting adverse events that occur after the adverse event reporting period are provided in Section 5.6.</p>
<p></p></div></div><div class=""><h2 id="section-9.3">9.3 Identification, Recording and Follow-Up</h2><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all adverse events (see Section 5.2.1 for definition) are recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF and reported to the Sponsor in accordance with instructions provided in this section and in Sections 5.45.6.</p>
<p>For each adverse event recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, the investigator will make an assessment of seriousness (see Section 5.2.2 for seriousness criteria), severity (see Section 5.3.3), and causality (see Section 5.3.4).</p>
<p>Investigators should use correct medical terminology/concepts when recording adverse events on the Adverse Event eCRF.  Avoid colloquialisms and abbreviations.</p>
<p>Only one adverse event term should be recorded in the event field on the Adverse Event eCRF.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Diagnosis versus Signs and Symptoms</p>
<p>A diagnosis (if known) should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF rather than individual signs and symptoms (e.g., record only liver failure or hepatitis rather than jaundice, asterixis, and elevated transaminases).  However, if a constellation of signs and/or symptoms cannot be medically characterized as a single diagnosis or syndrome at the time of reporting, each individual event should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF.  If a diagnosis is subsequently established, all previously reported adverse events based on signs and symptoms should be nullified and replaced by one adverse event report based on the single diagnosis, with a starting date that corresponds to the starting date of the first symptom of the eventual diagnosis.</p>
<p>Adverse Events That Are Secondary to Other Events</p>
<p>In general, adverse events that are secondary to other events (e.g., cascade events or clinical sequelae) should be identified by their primary cause, with the exception of severe or serious secondary events.  A medically significant secondary adverse event that is separated in time from the initiating event should be recorded as an independent event on the Adverse Event eCRF.  For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>•	If vomiting results in mild dehydration with no additional treatment in a healthy adult, only vomiting should be reported on the eCRF.</li>
<li>•	If vomiting results in severe dehydration, both events should be reported separately on the eCRF.</li>
<li>•	If a severe gastrointestinal hemorrhage leads to renal failure, both events should be reported separately on the eCRF.</li>
<li>•	If dizziness leads to a fall and consequent fracture, all three events should be reported separately on the eCRF.</li>
<li>•	If neutropenia is accompanied by an infection, both events should be reported separately on the eCRF.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>All adverse events should be recorded separately on the Adverse Event eCRF if it is unclear as to whether the events are associated.</p>
<p>Persistent or Recurrent Adverse Events</p>
<p>A persistent adverse event is one that extends continuously, without resolution, between patient evaluation timepoints.  Such events should only be recorded once on the Adverse Event eCRF.  The initial severity (intensity or grade) of the event will be recorded at the time the event is first reported.  If a persistent adverse event becomes more severe, the most extreme severity should also be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF.  If the event becomes serious, it should be reported to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning that the event became serious; see Section 5.4.2 for reporting instructions).  The Adverse Event eCRF should be updated by changing the event from "non-serious" to "serious," providing the date that the event became serious, and completing all data fields related to serious adverse events.</p>
<p>A recurrent adverse event is one that resolves between patient evaluation timepoints and subsequently recurs.  Each recurrence of an adverse event should be recorded as a separate event on the Adverse Event eCRF.</p>
<p>Abnormal Laboratory Values</p>
<p>Not every laboratory abnormality qualifies as an adverse event.  A laboratory test result must be reported as an adverse event if it meets any of the following criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li>•	Is accompanied by clinical symptoms</li>
<li>•	Results in a change in study treatment (e.g., dosage modification, treatment interruption, or treatment discontinuation)</li>
<li>•	Results in a medical intervention (e.g., potassium supplementation for hypokalemia) or a change in concomitant therapy</li>
<li>•	Is clinically significant in the investigator's judgment </li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>It is the investigator's responsibility to review all laboratory findings.  Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether an isolated laboratory abnormality should be classified as an adverse event.</p>
<p>If a clinically significant laboratory abnormality is a sign of a disease or syndrome (e.g., alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin 5  ULN associated with cholestasis), only the diagnosis (i.e., cholestasis) should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF.</p>
<p>If a clinically significant laboratory abnormality is not a sign of a disease or syndrome, the abnormality itself should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, along with a descriptor indicating whether the test result is above or below the normal range (e.g., "elevated potassium," as opposed to "abnormal potassium").  If the laboratory abnormality can be characterized by a precise clinical term per standard definitions, the clinical term should be recorded as the adverse event.  For example, an elevated serum potassium level of 7.0 mEq/L should be recorded as "hyperkalemia."</p>
<p>Observations of the same clinically significant laboratory abnormality from visit to visit should only be recorded once on the Adverse Event eCRF (see Section for details on recording persistent adverse events).</p>
<p>5.3.5.5	Abnormal Vital Sign Values</p>
<p>Not every vital sign abnormality qualifies as an adverse event.  A vital sign result must be reported as an adverse event if it meets any of the following criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li>•	Is accompanied by clinical symptoms</li>
<li>•	Results in a change in study treatment (e.g., dosage modification, treatment interruption, or treatment discontinuation)</li>
<li>•	Results in a medical intervention or a change in concomitant therapy</li>
<li>•	Is clinically significant in the investigator's judgment </li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>It is the investigator's responsibility to review all vital sign findings.  Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether an isolated vital sign abnormality should be classified as an adverse event.</p>
<p>If a clinically significant vital sign abnormality is a sign of a disease or syndrome (e.g., high blood pressure), only the diagnosis (i.e., hypertension) should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF.</p>
<p>Observations of the same clinically significant vital sign abnormality from visit to visit should only be recorded once on the Adverse Event eCRF (see Section 5.3.5.3 for details on recording persistent adverse events).</p>
<p>Abnormal Liver Function Tests</p>
<p>The finding of an elevated ALT or AST ( 3  ULN) in combination with either an elevated total bilirubin ( 2  ULN) or clinical jaundice in the absence of cholestasis or other causes of hyperbilirubinemia is considered to be an indicator of severe liver injury (as defined by Hy's Law).  Therefore, investigators must report as an adverse event the occurrence of either of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>•	Treatment-emergent ALT or AST  3  ULN in combination with total bilirubin  2  ULN</li>
<li>•	Treatment-emergent ALT or AST  3  ULN in combination with clinical jaundice</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>The most appropriate diagnosis or (if a diagnosis cannot be established) the abnormal laboratory values should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF (see Section 5.3.5.1) and reported to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event), either as a serious adverse event or an adverse event of special interest (see Section 5.4.2).</p>
<p>Deaths</p>
<p>All deaths that occur during the protocol-specified adverse event reporting period (see Section 5.3.1), regardless of relationship to study drug, must be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF and immediately reported to the Sponsor (see Section 5.4.2).  This includes death attributed to progression of COVID-19 pneumonia.</p>
<p>Death should be considered an outcome and not a distinct event.  The event or condition that caused or contributed to the fatal outcome should be recorded as the single medical concept on the Adverse Event eCRF.  Generally, only one such event should be reported.  If the cause of death is unknown and cannot be ascertained at the time of reporting, "unexplained death" should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF.  If the cause of death later becomes available (e.g., after autopsy), "unexplained death" should be replaced by the established cause of death.  The term "sudden death" should not be used unless combined with the presumed cause of death (e.g., "sudden cardiac death").</p>
<p>If the death is attributed solely to progression of COVID-19 pneumonia, "COVID-19 pneumonia progression" should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF.</p>
<p>Deaths that occur after the adverse event reporting period should be reported as described in Section 5.6.</p>
<p>Preexisting Medical Conditions</p>
<p>A preexisting medical condition is one that is present at the screening visit for this study.  Such conditions should be recorded on the General Medical History and Baseline Conditions eCRF.</p>
<p>A preexisting medical condition should be recorded as an adverse event only if the frequency, severity, or character of the condition worsens during the study.  When recording such events on the Adverse Event eCRF, it is important to convey the concept that the preexisting condition has changed by including applicable descriptors (e.g., "more frequent headaches").</p>
<p>Lack of Efficacy or Worsening of COVID-19 Pneumonia</p>
<p>Events that are clearly consistent with the expected pattern of progression of the underlying disease should not be recorded as adverse events (with the exception of death due to COVID-19 pneumonia progression as described in Section 5.3.5.7).  These data will be captured as efficacy assessment data only.  If there is any uncertainty as to whether an event is due to disease progression, it should be reported as an adverse event.</p>
<p>Hospitalization or Prolonged Hospitalization</p>
<p>Any adverse event that results in hospitalization (i.e., inpatient admission to a hospital) or prolonged hospitalization should be documented and reported as a serious adverse event (per the definition of serious adverse event in Section 5.2.2), except as outlined below.</p>
<p>An event that leads to hospitalization under the following circumstances should not be reported as an adverse event or a serious adverse event:</p>
<ul>
<li>•	Hospitalization for respite care</li>
<li>•	Hospitalization for a preexisting condition, provided that all of the following criteria are met:</li>
</ul>
<p>The hospitalization was planned prior to the study or was scheduled during the study when elective surgery became necessary because of the expected normal progression of the disease</p>
<p>The patient has not experienced an adverse event</p>
<p></p>
<p>An event that leads to hospitalization under the following circumstances is not considered to be a serious adverse event, but should be reported as an adverse event instead:</p>
<ul>
<li>•	Hospitalization that was necessary because of patient requirement for outpatient care outside of normal outpatient clinic operating hours</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>Cases of Accidental Overdose or Medication Error</p>
<p>Accidental overdose and medication error (hereafter collectively referred to as "special situations"), are defined as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>•	Accidental overdose:  accidental administration of a drug in a quantity that is higher than the assigned dose</li>
<li>•	Medication error:  accidental deviation in the administration of a drug </li>
</ul>
<p>In some cases, a medication error may be intercepted prior to administration of the drug.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Special situations are not in themselves adverse events, but may result in adverse events.  Each adverse event associated with a special situation should be recorded separately on the Adverse Event eCRF.  If the associated adverse event fulfills seriousness criteria, the event should be reported to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event; see Section 5.4.2).  For TCZ (or matching placebo), adverse events associated with special situations should be recorded as described below for each situation:</p>
<ul>
<li>•	Accidental overdose:  Enter the adverse event term.  Check the "Accidental overdose" and "Medication error" boxes.</li>
<li>•	Medication error that does not qualify as an overdose:  Enter the adverse event term.  Check the "Medication error" box.</li>
<li>•	Medication error that qualifies as an overdose:  Enter the adverse event term.  Check the "Accidental overdose" and "Medication error" boxes.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>In addition, all special situations associated with TCZ (or matching placebo), regardless of whether they result in an adverse event, should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF as described below:</p>
<ul>
<li>•	Accidental overdose:  Enter the drug name and "accidental overdose" as the event term.  Check the "Accidental overdose" and "Medication error" boxes.</li>
<li>•	Medication error that does not qualify as an overdose:  Enter the name of the drug administered and a description of the error (e.g., wrong dose administered, wrong dosing schedule, incorrect route of administration, wrong drug, expired drug administered) as the event term.  Check the "Medication error" box.</li>
<li>•	Medication error that qualifies as an overdose:  Enter the drug name and "accidental overdose" as the event term.  Check the "Accidental overdose" and "Medication error" boxes.  Enter a description of the error in the additional case details.</li>
<li>•	Intercepted medication error:  Enter the drug name and "intercepted medication error" as the event term.  Check the "Medication error" box.  Enter a description of the error in the additional case details.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>As an example, an accidental overdose that resulted in a headache would require two entries on the Adverse Event eCRF, one entry to report the accidental overdose and one entry to report the headache.  The "Accidental overdose" and "Medication error" boxes would need to be checked for both entries.</p>
<p>Safety Biomarker Data</p>
<p>Adverse event reports will not be derived from safety biomarker data by the Sponsor, and safety biomarker data will not be included in the formal safety analyses for this study.  In addition, safety biomarker data will not inform decisions on patient management.</p></div></div><div class=""><h3 id="section-9.3.1">9.3.1 Identification</h3><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>A consistent methodology of non-directive questioning should be adopted for eliciting adverse event information at all patient evaluation timepoints.

<p></p></div></div><div class=""><h2 id="section-10.9">10.9 Interim Analyses</h2><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Up to three interim looks for efficacy will be carried out on the data with mortality rate at 28 days (secondary endpoint) evaluated for interim efficacy analyses.  The interim looks will occur after roughly 111, 222, and 333 patients are enrolled, but all interims are subject to change depending on enrollment.  If the sample size is increased during the study, the remaining efficacy interims will be performed at similar proportions of information to the original planned efficacy interim analyses.</p>
<p>The first efficacy interim analysis will be conducted when approximately 111 patients (74 TCZ and 37 placebo) have reached the 28-day follow-up time point and will be based on the mortality rate at 28 days (secondary endpoint).  If the results of one of the interim analyses meets the pre-specified criteria for efficacy, further enrollment in the placebo arm will be discontinued and all enrolled patients will receive open-label TCZ.  At this point, efficacy will be declared.  If the study is at least 90% enrolled within 5 weeks (28 days follow up plus 1 week to perform the analysis) of the 111th patient being enrolled, then no interim analyses will be conducted.</p>
<p>If there is a potential for further recruitment into the placebo arm to be stopped for positive efficacy because of the interim analysis, the type I error rate will be controlled to ensure statistical validity is maintained.  Specifically, the Lan-DeMets -spending function that approximates the O'Brien-Fleming boundary will be applied to determine the critical value for stopping for positive efficacy at the interim analysis (DeMets and Lan 1994).  Interim analyses for efficacy will use the Fisher’s exact test for difference in proportions for mortality at 28 days and will utilize an O’Brien-Fleming alpha-spending function.  The efficacy boundaries for the z-scores at the four looks (three interim looks and final analysis) are 4.364, 2.986, 2.377, and 2.011.</p>
<p>The critical value at the final analysis will be adjusted accordingly to maintain the protocol-specified overall type I error rate, per standard Lan-DeMets methodology.</p>
<p>The study management team will remain blinded unless the results meet the efficacy criteria (boundary is crossed). The interim efficacy analyses will be produced by a statistical programmer and statistician independent of the study management team and will reviewed by a Data Monitoring Committee (DMC).</p>
<p>Full statistical details of the planned interim analyses, along with the rationale and timing will be documented in an interim statistical analysis plan, which will be made available to the relevant health authorities before the data snapshot for the first interim.</p>
<p>A Data Monitoring Committee will also evaluate safety according to policies and procedures detailed in a DMC Charter.  Regular safety reviews will begin after approximately 15 patients (10 TCZ, 5 placebo) have been enrolled and reached 14-day follow-up.  Early stopping criteria based on compelling efficacy or an imbalance in adverse events will be detailed in the DMC charter.  The safety interim analyses will also be conducted by a statistical programmer and statistician independent from the study management team and will be reviewed by the DMC.  Interactions between the DMC and Sponsor will be carried out as specified in the DMC Charter.</p>
<p>The Data Monitoring Committee will initially consist of Sponsor representatives not involved in any operational aspects of the study before transitioning to a fully independent data monitoring committee (iDMC) when feasible.</p></div></div><div class=""><h2 id="section-10.10">10.10 Multiplicity Adjustments</h2><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p></p></div></div><div class=""><h2 id="section-10.11">10.11 Sample Size Determination</h2><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>The estimated sample size was determined for the primary endpoint of comparison of clinical status based on a 7-category ordinal scale at Day 28 using the Van Elteren test.</p>

In addition, at the end of the study, the investigator will receive the patient data, including an audit trail containing a complete record of all changes to data.</p>
<p></p>
<p>eCRFs are to be completed through use of a Sponsor-designated EDC system.  Sites will receive training and have access to a manual for appropriate eCRF completion.  eCRFs will be submitted electronically to the Sponsor and should be handled in accordance with instructions from the Sponsor.</p>
<p>All eCRFs should be completed by designated, trained site staff.  eCRFs should be reviewed and electronically signed and dated by the investigator or a designee.</p>
<p>At the end of the study, the investigator will receive patient data for his or her site in a readable format that must be kept with the study records.  Acknowledgement of receipt of the data is required.</p>
<p>Investigators will provide the Sponsor with sufficient, accurate financial information in accordance with local regulations to allow the Sponsor to submit complete and accurate financial certification or disclosure statements to the appropriate health authorities.  Investigators are responsible for providing information on financial interests during the course of the study and for 1 year after completion of the study (see definition of end of study in Section 3.2).</p>
<p></p></div></div><div class=""><h3 id="section-11.2.2">11.2.2 Sponsor Responsibilities</h3><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>The Sponsor will be responsible for data management of this study, including quality checking of the data.  Data entered manually will be collected via EDC through use of eCRFs.  Sites will be responsible for data entry into the EDC system.  In the event of discrepant data, the Sponsor will request data clarification from the sites, which the sites will resolve electronically in the EDC system.</p>
<p>The Sponsor will produce an EDC Study Specification document that describes the quality checking to be performed on the data.  Central laboratory data will be sent directly to the Sponsor, using the Sponsor's standard procedures to handle and process the electronic transfer of these data.</p>
<p>eCRFs and correction documentation will be maintained in the EDC system's audit trail.  System backups for data stored by the Sponsor and records retention for the study data will be consistent with the Sponsor's standard procedures.</p>
<p></p></div></div><div class=""><h2 id="section-11.3">11.3 Informed Consent Process</h2><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>The Sponsor's sample Informed Consent Form (and ancillary sample Informed Consent Forms such as an Assent Form or Mobile Nursing Informed Consent Form, if applicable) will be provided to each site.  If applicable, it will be provided in a certified translation of the local language.  The Sponsor or its designee must review and approve any proposed deviations from the Sponsor's sample Informed Consent Forms or any alternate consent forms proposed by the site (collectively, the "Consent Forms") before IRB/EC submission.  The final IRB/ECapproved Consent Forms must be provided to the Sponsor for health authority submission purposes according to local requirements.</p>
<p>If applicable, the Informed Consent Form will contain separate sections for any optional procedures.  The investigator or authorized designee will explain to each patient the objectives, methods, and potential risks associated with each optional procedure.  Patients will be told that they are free to refuse to participate and may withdraw their consent at any time for any reason.  A separate, specific signature will be required to document a patient's agreement to participate in optional procedures.  Patients who decline to participate will not provide a separate signature.</p>
<p>The Consent Forms must be signed and dated by the patient or the patient's legally authorized representative or where allowed, HCP consent on behalf of the patient before his or her participation in the study.  Due to the pandemic situation and restricted hospital access, where allowed, verbal consent may be given by the patient’s legally authorized representative and this must be documented by the investigator or authorized designee.  The case history or clinical records for each patient shall document the informed consent process and that written informed consent was obtained prior to participation in the study.</p>
<p>The Consent Forms should be revised whenever there are changes to study procedures or when new information becomes available that may affect the willingness of the patient to participate.  The final revised IRB/EC-approved Consent Forms must be provided to the Sponsor for health authority submission purposes.</p>
<p>If the Consent Forms are revised (through an amendment or an addendum) while a patient is participating in the study, the patient or a legally authorized representative must re-consent by signing the most current version of the Consent Forms or the addendum, in accordance with applicable laws and IRB/EC policy.  For any updated or revised Consent Forms, the case history or clinical records for each patient shall document the informed consent process and that written informed consent was obtained using the updated/revised Consent Forms for continued participation in the study.</p>
<p>A copy of each signed Consent Form must be provided to the patient or the patient's legally authorized representative.  All signed and dated Consent Forms must remain in each patient's study file or in the site file and must be available for verification by study monitors at any time.</p>
<p>For sites in the United States, each Consent Form may also include patient authorization to allow use and disclosure of personal health information in compliance with the U.S. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) of 1996.  If the site utilizes a separate Authorization Form for patient authorization for use and disclosure of personal health information under the HIPAA regulations, the review, approval, and other processes outlined above apply except that IRB review and approval may not be required per study site policies.</p></div></div><div class=""><h3 id="section-11.3.1">11.3.1 Informed Consent for Rescreening</h3><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p></p></div></div><div class=""><h3 id="section-11.3.2">11.3.2 Informed Consent for Use of Remaining Samples in Exploratory Research</h3><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p></p></div></div><div class=""><h2 id="section-11.4">11.4 Committees</h2><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>This protocol, the Informed Consent Forms, any information to be given to the patient, and relevant supporting information must be submitted to the IRB/EC (national or regional) by the Principal Investigator and reviewed and approved by the IRB/EC before the study is initiated.  In addition, any patient recruitment materials must be approved by the IRB/EC.</p>
<p>The Principal Investigator is responsible for providing written summaries of the status of the study to the IRB/EC annually or more frequently in accordance with the requirements, policies, and procedures established by the IRB/EC.  Investigators are also responsible for promptly informing the IRB/EC of any protocol amendments (see Section 9.6).</p>
<p>In addition to the requirements for reporting all adverse events to the Sponsor, investigators must comply with requirements for reporting serious adverse events to the local health authority and IRB/EC.  Investigators may receive written IND safety reports or other safety-related communications from the Sponsor.  Investigators are responsible for ensuring that such reports are reviewed and processed in accordance with health authority requirements and the policies and procedures established by their IRB/EC, and archived in the site's study file.</p>
<p>This trial will be sponsored and managed by F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd.  The Sponsor will provide clinical operations management, data management, and medical monitoring.</p>
<p>Approximately 60 sites globally will participate to enroll approximately 450 patients.  Enrollment will occur through an IxRS.</p>
<p>Central facilities will be used for certain study assessments throughout the study (e.g., specified laboratory tests, biomarker and PK analyses), as specified in Section 4.5.  Accredited local laboratories will be used for routine monitoring; local laboratory ranges will be collected.</p>
<p>A DMC will be employed to monitor and evaluate patient safety throughout the study.</p>
<p></p></div></div><div class=""><h2 id="section-11.5">11.5 Risk Management</h2><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>The Sponsor will implement a system to manage the quality of the study, focusing on processes and data that are essential to ensuring patient safety and data integrity.  Prior to study initiation, the Sponsor will identify potential risks associated with critical trial processes and data and will implement plans for evaluating and controlling these risks.  Risk evaluation and control will include the selection of risk-based parameters (e.g., adverse event rate, protocol deviation rate) and the establishment of quality tolerance limits for these parameters prior to study initiation.  Detection of deviations from quality tolerance limits will trigger an evaluation to determine if action is needed.  Details on the establishment and monitoring of quality tolerance limits will be provided in a Quality Tolerance Limit Management Plan.</p>
<p>Site visits will be conducted remotely by the Sponsor or an authorized representative for inspection of study data, patients' medical records, and eCRFs.  The investigator will permit national and local health authorities; Sponsor monitors, representatives, and collaborators; and the IRBs/ECs to inspect facilities and records relevant to this study.</p>
<p></p></div></div><div class=""><h2 id="section-11.6">11.6 Data Governance</h2><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>The Sponsor maintains confidentiality standards by coding each patient enrolled in the study through assignment of a unique patient identification number.  This means that patient names are not included in data sets that are transmitted to any Sponsor location.</p>
<p>Patient medical information obtained by this study is confidential and may be disclosed to third parties only as permitted by the Informed Consent Form (or separate authorization for use and disclosure of personal health information) signed by the patient, unless permitted or required by law.</p>
<p>Medical information may be given to a patient's personal physician or other appropriate medical personnel responsible for the patient's welfare, for treatment purposes.</p>
<p>Given the complexity and exploratory nature of exploratory biomarker analyses, data derived from these analyses will generally not be provided to study investigators or patients unless required by law.  The aggregate results of any conducted research will be available in accordance with the effective Sponsor policy on study data publication (see Section 9.6).</p>
<p>Data generated by this study must be available for inspection upon request by representatives of national and local health authorities, Sponsor monitors, representatives, and collaborators, and the IRB/EC for each study site, as appropriate.</p>
<p>Study data, which may include data on genomic variants, may be submitted to government or other health research databases or shared with researchers, government agencies, companies, or other groups that are not participating in this study.  These data may be combined with or linked to other data and used for research purposes, to advance science and public health, or for analysis, development, and commercialization of products to treat and diagnose disease.  In addition, redacted Clinical Study Reports and other summary reports will be provided upon request (see Section 9.6).</p>
<p>Records and documents pertaining to the conduct of this study and the distribution of IMP, including eCRFs, Informed Consent Forms, laboratory test results, and medication inventory records, must be retained by the Principal Investigator for 15 years after completion or discontinuation of the study or for the length of time required by relevant national or local health authorities, whichever is longer.  After that period of time, the documents may be destroyed, subject to local regulations.</p>
<p>No records may be disposed of without the written approval of the Sponsor.  Written notification should be provided to the Sponsor prior to transferring any records to another party or moving them to another location.</p>
<p>Roche will retain study data for 25 years after the final study results have been reported or for the length of time required by relevant national or local health authorities, whichever is longer.</p>
<p>Regardless of the outcome of a trial, the Sponsor is dedicated to openly providing information on the trial to healthcare professionals and to the public, at scientific congresses, in clinical trial registries, and in peer-reviewed journals.  The Sponsor will comply with all requirements for publication of study results.  Study data may be shared with others who are not participating in this study (see Section 8.4 for details), and redacted Clinical Study Reports and other summary reports will be made available upon request.  For more information, refer to the Roche Global Policy on Sharing of Clinical Trials Data at the following website:</p>
<p>www.roche.com/roche_global_policy_on_sharing_of_clinical_study_information.pdf</p>
<p>The results of this study may be published or presented at scientific congresses.  For all clinical trials in patients involving an IMP for which a marketing authorization application has been filed or approved in any country, the Sponsor aims to submit a journal manuscript reporting primary clinical trial results within 6 months after the availability of the respective Clinical Study Report.  In addition, for all clinical trials in patients involving an IMP for which a marketing authorization application has been filed or approved in any country, the Sponsor aims to publish results from analyses of additional endpoints and exploratory data that are clinically meaningful and statistically sound.</p>
<p>The investigator must agree to submit all manuscripts or abstracts to the Sponsor prior to submission for publication or presentation.  This allows the Sponsor to protect proprietary information and to provide comments based on information from other studies that may not yet be available to the investigator.</p>
<p>In accordance with standard editorial and ethical practice, the Sponsor will generally support publication of multicenter trials only in their entirety and not as individual center data.  In this case, a coordinating investigator will be designated by mutual agreement.</p>
<p>Authorship will be determined by mutual agreement and in line with International Committee of Medical Journal Editors authorship requirements.  Any formal publication of the study in which contribution of Sponsor personnel exceeded that of conventional monitoring will be considered as a joint publication by the investigator and the appropriate Sponsor personnel.</p>
<p>Any inventions and resulting patents, improvements, and/or know-how originating from the use of data from this study will become and remain the exclusive and unburdened property of the Sponsor, except where agreed otherwise.</p>
<p></p></div></div><div class=""><h2 id="section-11.7">11.7 Source Data</h2><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Due to the pandemic situation, access to hospitals is restricted; therefore, only remote data monitoring will be performed for this study.  Study monitors will perform ongoing remote data review to confirm that critical protocol data (i.e., source data) entered into the eCRFs by authorized site personnel are accurate and complete. Sites will be asked to implement a QC step of a second person reviewing the data entry in the eCRF where possible.</p>
<p>Source documents (paper or electronic) are those in which patient data are recorded and documented for the first time.  They include, but are not limited to, hospital records, clinical and office charts, laboratory notes, memoranda, patient-reported outcomes, evaluation checklists, pharmacy dispensing records, recorded data from automated instruments, copies of transcriptions that are certified after verification as being accurate and complete, microfiche, photographic negatives, microfilm or magnetic media, X rays, patient files, and records kept at pharmacies, laboratories, and medico technical departments involved in a clinical trial.</p>
<p>Before study initiation, the types of source documents that are to be generated will be clearly defined in the Trial Monitoring Plan.  This includes any protocol data to be entered directly into the eCRFs (i.e., no prior written or electronic record of the data) and considered source data.</p>
<p>Source documents that are required to verify the validity and completeness of data entered into the eCRFs must not be obliterated or destroyed and must be retained per the policy for retention of records described in Section 7.5.</p>
<p>To facilitate source data verification and review, the investigators and institutions must provide the Sponsor direct access to applicable source documents and reports for trial-related monitoring, Sponsor audits, and IRB/EC review.  The study site must also allow inspection by applicable health authorities.</p>
<p>When clinical observations are entered directly into a study site's computerized medical record system (i.e., in lieu of original hardcopy records), the electronic record can serve as the source document if the system has been validated in accordance with health authority requirements pertaining to computerized systems used in clinical research.  An acceptable computerized data collection system allows preservation of the original entry of data.  If original data are modified, the system should maintain a viewable audit trail that shows the original data as well as the reason for the change, name of the person making the change, and date of the change.</p>
<p></p></div></div><div class=""><h2 id="section-11.8">11.8 Protocol Deviations</h2><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>The investigator should document and explain any protocol deviations.  The investigator should promptly report any deviations that might have an impact on patient safety and data integrity to the Sponsor and to the IRB/EC in accordance with established IRB/EC policies and procedures.  The Sponsor will review all protocol deviations and assess whether any represent a serious breach of Good Clinical Practice guidelines and require reporting to health authorities.  As per the Sponsor's standard operating procedures, prospective requests to deviate from the protocol, including requests to waive protocol eligibility criteria, are not allowed.</p>
<p></p></div></div><div class=""><h2 id="section-11.9">11.9 Early Site Closure</h2><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>The Sponsor has the right to terminate this study at any time.  Reasons for terminating the study may include, but are not limited to, the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>•	The incidence or severity of adverse events in this or other studies indicates a potential health hazard to patients</li>
<li>•	Patient enrollment is unsatisfactory</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>The Sponsor will notify the investigator if the Sponsor decides to discontinue the study.</p>
<p>The Sponsor has the right to close a site at any time.  Reasons for closing a site may include, but are not limited to, the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>•	Excessively slow recruitment</li>
<li>•	Poor protocol adherence</li>
<li>•	Inaccurate or incomplete data recording</li>
<li>•	Non-compliance with the International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) guideline for Good Clinical Practice</li>
