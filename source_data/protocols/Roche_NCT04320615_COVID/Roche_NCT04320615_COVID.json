Given the results of studies outlined above, TCZ, along with standard of care (SOC) treatment, could provide efficacy, offering the potential to treat COVID-19 in hospitalized populations more effectively than current SOC alone. Extensive safety data have previously been generated on the use of TCZ in other indications. Therefore, a placebocontrolled study in combination with SOC to assess safety and efficacy of TCZ in hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia is justified to address the high unmet need and burden of disease in this severely ill population.",

Given the results of studies outlined above, TCZ, along with standard of care (SOC) treatment, could provide efficacy, offering the potential to treat COVID-19 in hospitalized populations more effectively than current SOC alone. Extensive safety data have previously been generated on the use of TCZ in other indications. Therefore, placebocontrolled study in combination with SOC to assess safety and efficacy of TCZ in hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 neumonia is justified to address the high unmet need and burden of disease in this severely ill population.",

At the time of enrollment, patients must have SpO2 \uf0a3 93% or PaO2/FiO2 \uf03c 300 mmHg despite being on SOC, which may include anti-viral treatment, low dose steroids, and supportive care.</p>\n<p>Patients in whom, in the opinion of the treating physician, progression to death is imminent and inevitable within the next 24 hours, irrespective of the provision of treatments, will be excluded from the study.  Patients with active tuberculosis (TB) or suspected active bacterial, fungal, viral, or other infection (besides COVID-19) will be excluded from the study.</p>\n<p>Patients will be randomized as soon as possible after screening at a 2:1 ratio to receive blinded treatment of either TCZ or a matching placebo, respectively.  Study treatment must be given in combination with SOC.  The randomization will be stratified by geographic region (North America and Europe) and mechanical ventilation (yes, no).  The proportion of patients who are on a mechanical ventilator at the time of randomization will be capped at no more than 50% of the overall study population.</p>\n<p>Patients assigned to the TCZ arm will receive one infusion of TCZ 8 mg/kg, with a maximum dose of 800 mg, and patients assigned to the placebo arm will receive one infusion of placebo, both in addition to SOC.</p>\n<p>For both arms, if the clinical signs or symptoms worsen or do not improve (reflected by sustained fever or at least a one-category worsening on the 7-category ordinal scale of clinical status), one additional infusion of blinded treatment of TCZ or placebo can be given, 8\u201324 hours after the initial infusion.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><span class=\"ich-m11-overall-design-title\">Number of Arms</span>: 2</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><span class=\"ich-m11-overall-design-title\">Trial Blind Schema</span>: Double-blind.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><span class=\"ich-m11-overall-design-title\">Blinded Roles</span>: The following roles indicated will not be made aware of the treatment group assignment during the trial: Study site personnel, participants, and the sponsor.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><span class=\"ich-m11-overall-design-title\">Number of Participants</span>:</p>\n<p>A target of 450 participants will be enrolled.</p>\n<p><span class=\"ich-m11-overall-design-title\">Duration</span></p>\n<p>Total planned duration of trial intervention for each participant:</p>\n<p>Approximately 6 months</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><span class=\"ich-m11-overall-design-title\">Committees</span>:</p>\n<p>A Data Monitoring Committee will also evaluate safety according to policies and procedures detailed in a DMC Charter.  Regular safety reviews will begin after approximately 15 patients (10 TCZ, 5 placebo) have been enrolled and reached 14-day follow-up.  Early stopping criteria based on compelling efficacy or an imbalance in adverse events will be detailed in the DMC charter.  The safety interim analyses will also be conducted by a statistical programmer independent from the study management team and will be reviewed by the DMC.  Interactions between the DMC and Sponsor will be carried out as specified in the DMC Charter.</p>\n<p>The Data Monitoring Committee may initially consist of Sponsor representatives not involved in any operational aspects of the study before transitioning to a fully independent data monitoring committee (iDMC) when feasible.</p>\n<p></p></div>",

TCZ binds specifically to both soluble IL-6R (sIL-6R) and membrane-bound IL-6R and has been shown to inhibit both soluble and membrane-bound IL-6R\uf02dmediated signaling.  IL-6 is a pleiotropic pro inflammatory multifunctional cytokine produced by a variety of cell types and has been shown to be involved in diverse physiological processes such as T-cell activation; induction of acute phase proteins; stimulation of hematopoietic precursor cell growth and differentiation; proliferation of hepatic, dermal, and neural cells; bone metabolism; lipid metabolism; hepatoprotection; and fibrosis.  Elevated tissue and serum levels of IL-6 have been implicated in the disease pathology of several inflammatory and autoimmune disorders including rheumatoid arthritis (RA), Castleman disease, systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (sJIA), polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (pJIA), giant cell arteritis (GCA), Takayasu arteritis (TAK), systemic sclerosis (SSc), and cytokine-release syndrome (CRS).  Inhibition of the biological activity of IL-6 or IL-6R has been effective in the treatment of these disorders, including chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell induced CRS, for which treatment with TCZ has been approved in many countries.</p>\n<p>TCZ has IV and SC formulations.  Some of the above-listed indications (RA, sJIA, and pJIA) have received approval for both the IV and SC formulations, whereas others have received approval exclusively for the IV (Castleman disease and CRS) or the SC (GCA and TAK) formulation.</p>\n<p>The estimated cumulative clinical trial exposure to tocilizumab from the DIBD (28 April 1997) and until 10 April 2019 (DLP for PBRER) is 24,826 patients (40154.98 patient years [PY]).  Since the IBD (11 April 2005), the estimated cumulative market exposure to tocilizumab until 10 April 2019 is 1,301,050 patients (1,053,779 PY).  The combined cumulative post-marketing exposure of patients to IV tocilizumab is estimated to be 896,672 patients (726,347 PY).

Characteristics of CRS include fever, fatigue, headache, encephalopathy, hypotension, tachycardia, coagulopathy, nausea, capillary leak, and multi-organ dysfunction.  The reported incidence of CRS after CAR T-cell therapy ranges from 50% to 100%, with 13% to 48% of patients experiencing the severe or life-threatening form.  Serum levels of inflammatory cytokines are elevated, particularly interleukin-6 (IL-6).  The severity of symptoms may correlate with the serum cytokine concentrations and the duration of exposure to the inflammatory cytokines.</p>\n<p>On August 30, 2017, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved tocilizumab (Actemra\uf0e2) for the treatment of severe or life-threatening CAR T cell-induced CRS in adults and in pediatric patients 2 years of age and older.  The approved dose is 8 mg/kg for body weight \uf0b3 30kg and 12 mg/kg for body weight \uf03c 30 kg.  Up to three additional doses may be given if no improvement of sign/symptoms, and the interval between the subsequent doses should be at least 8 hours.</p>\n<p>The approval of TCZ was based on a retrospective analysis of data for patients treated with TCZ who developed CRS after treatment with tisagenlecleucel (Kymriah\uf0e2) or axicabtagene ciloleucel (Yescarta\uf0e2) in prospective clinical trials, (Le et al. 2018).  Thirty-one out of the 45 patients (69%) from the CTL019 series achieved a response (defined as being afebrile and off vasopressors for at least 24 hours within 14 days of the first dose of TCZ (maximum up to two doses) and without use of additional treatment other than corticosteroids) within 14 days of the first dose of TCZ, and the median time from the first dose to response was 4 days.  Eight of the 15 patients (53%) from the axicabtagene ciloleucel series achieved a response, and the median time to response was 4.5 days.  The response rates were largely consistent among subgroups such as age group, sex, race, ethnicity, grade of CRS at first dose of TCZ, and duration of CRS prior to treatment with TCZ.  There were no reports of adverse reactions attributable to TCZ.</p>\n<p>Pharmacokinetic (PK) data were available for 27 patients after the first dose of TCZ and for 8 patients after a second dose of TCZ.

The PK modeling analysis showed that patients with CRS had a faster clearance of TCZ than healthy volunteers and other patient populations, and simulations showed that exposure was considered acceptable with up to four doses of TCZ at least 8 hours apart in patients with CRS.</p>\n<p>TCZ is also approved for CAR-T induced severe or life-threatening CRS in the European Union and certain other countries.</p></div>",

Signs of a possible hypersensitivity reaction include, but are not limited to, the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\u2022\tFever, chills, pruritus, urticaria, angioedema, and skin rash</li>\n<li>\u2022\tCardiopulmonary reactions, including chest pain, dyspnea, hypotension, or hypertension</li>\n</ul>\n<p></p>\n<p>TCZ infusions will be administered to patients at the site under close supervision.  Health care professionals administering TCZ infusions should be trained in the appropriate procedures for TCZ administration, should be able to recognize the symptoms associated with potential hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, and should have the appropriate medication available for immediate use in case of hypersensitivity reaction such as anaphylaxis during or after administration of TCZ.  The patient should be treated according to the standard of care for management of the hypersensitivity reaction.</p>\n<p>If a patient has symptoms of serious hypersensitivity reactions, such as anaphylaxis, or requires an interruption of the study drug because of symptoms of hypersensitivity including anaphylaxis, administration of TCZ must be discontinued permanently.</p>\n<p>Serious Infections and Opportunistic Infections</p>\n<p>Physicians should exercise caution when considering the use of TCZ in patients with increased risk of infection, such as a history of recurring infections or with underlying conditions (e.g., diabetes mellitus) which may predispose patients to serious infections and opportunistic infections such as TB and viral reactivations (e.g., hepatitis B virus).</p>\n<p>Vigilance for timely detection of serious infection is recommended for patients receiving biologic agents, as signs and symptoms of acute inflammation may be lessened because of suppression of the acute-phase reaction.  The effects of TCZ on CRP and neutrophils, and the signs and symptoms of infection, should be considered when evaluating a patient for a potential infection.  It is recommended that neutropenic patients (ANC \uf03c 1000/\uf06dL) undergo weekly surveillance blood cultures during the study.</p>\n<p>If a patient develops a serious infection, administration of TCZ should be discontinued.</p>\n<p>Gastrointestinal Perforations</p>\n<p>Symptomatic diverticulosis, diverticulitis, or chronic ulcerative lower GI disease, such as Crohn disease, ulcerative colitis, or other chronic lower GI conditions, might predispose patients to GI perforations.  Timely diagnosis and appropriate treatment may reduce the potential for complications of diverticular disease and thus reduce the risk of GI perforations.</p>\n<p>Discontinuation of TCZ is required for patients who develop GI perforations.</p>\n<p>Hematologic Abnormalities</p>\n<p>Decreases in neutrophil counts, platelet counts, and fibrinogen levels have been observed following treatment with TCZ for labelled indications.  Treatment-related neutropenia was not associated with serious infection in clinical trials in any indication and no association between decreases in platelet counts and serious bleeding events has been observed.</p>\n<p>Demyelinating Disorders</p>\n<p>The effect of treatment with TCZ on demyelinating disorders is not known; events have been reported rarely.  Physicians should exercise caution when considering the use of TCZ in patients with preexisting or recent-onset demyelinating disorders.</p>\n<p>Patients should be closely monitored for signs and symptoms potentially indicative of central demyelinating disorders.</p>\n<p>Elevated Liver Enzymes</p>\n<p>In clinical trials, mild and moderate elevations of hepatic transaminases have been observed with TCZ treatment.</p>\n<p>Recommended TCZ dose modifications for elevated liver enzymes in these populations are not applicable to this study due to single dose therapy (with possible additional infusion) with TCZ or placebo.</p>\n<p>Patients who develop elevated liver function tests during the study must have repeat tests performed as clinically indicated until levels return to baseline, even if they withdraw from the study.  If the specialist deems a liver biopsy necessary, the prepared histologic slides will be requested by the Sponsor for central review by a third party, and the biopsy report should be forwarded to the Sponsor.</p>\n<p>CYP450 Enzyme Normalization</p>\n<p>The expression of hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzymes is suppressed by cytokines, such as IL-6, that stimulate chronic inflammation.  TCZ normalizes expression of these enzymes.  The effect of TCZ on CYP450 enzymes (except CYP2C19 and CYP2D6) is clinically relevant for CYP450 substrates with a narrow therapeutic index and/or when the dose is individually adjusted.</p>\n<p>When starting or stopping therapy with TCZ, patients taking medicinal products which are individually dose adjusted and are metabolized via CYP450 CYP3A4, CYP1A2, CYP2B6, or CYP2C9 (e.g., atorvastatin, calcium-channel blockers, theophylline, warfarin, phenprocoumon, phenytoin, cyclosporine, or benzodiazepines) should be monitored as doses of these products may need to be adjusted to maintain their therapeutic effect.</p>\n<p></p></div>",

The Sponsor intends to enroll approximately 450 patients that have been diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia and meet the entry criteria in centers globally.</p>\n<p>Patients must be at least 18 years of age with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) infection per WHO criteria, including a positive PCR of any specimen (e.g., respiratory, blood, urine, stool, other bodily fluid).  At the time of enrollment, patients must have SpO2 \uf0a3 93% or PaO2/FiO2 \uf03c 300 mmHg despite being on SOC, which may include anti-viral treatment, low dose steroids, and supportive care.</p>\n<p>Patients in whom, in the opinion of the treating physician, progression to death is imminent and inevitable within the next 24 hours, irrespective of the provision of treatments, will be excluded from the study.  Patients with active tuberculosis (TB) or suspected active bacterial, fungal, viral, or other infection (besides COVID-19) will be excluded from the study.</p>\n<p>Patients will be randomized as soon as possible after screening at a 2:1 ratio to receive blinded treatment of either TCZ or a matching placebo, respectively.  Study treatment must be given in combination with SOC.  The randomization will be stratified by geographic region (North America and Europe) and mechanical ventilation (yes, no).  The proportion of patients who are on a mechanical ventilator at the time of randomization will be capped at no more than 50% of the overall study population.</p>\n<p>Patients assigned to the TCZ arm will receive one infusion of TCZ 8 mg/kg, with a maximum dose of 800 mg, and patients assigned to the placebo arm will receive one infusion of placebo (see Section 4.3), both in addition to SOC.</p>\n<p>For both arms, if the clinical signs or symptoms worsen or do not improve (reflected by sustained fever or at least a one-category worsening on the 7-category ordinal scale of clinical status; see Section 4.5.10), one additional infusion of blinded treatment of TCZ or placebo can be given, 8\u201324 hours after the initial infusion.</p>\n<p>Patients who do not meet the criteria for participation in this study (screen failure) may qualify for one re-screening opportunity (for a total of 2 screenings per participant) at the investigator\u2019s discretion.  Patients are not required to re-sign the consent form if they are re-screened within 7 days after previously signing the consent form.  The investigator will record the reasons for screen failure in the screening log in Section 4.5.1.</p>\n<p>The study assessments to be conducted include the following: physical examination, vital signs, oxygen saturation, assessment of consciousness, presence and absence of respiratory support, adverse events, concomitant therapies, clinical laboratory tests, and nasopharyngeal swabs.  Please see Appendix 1, Appendix 2, and Appendix 3 for details concerning the timing of these assessments.</p>\n<p>Patients will be followed up for a total of 60 days after first dose of study medication.</p>\n<p>If patients are discharged from hospital prior to Day 28, follow up visits should occur twice weekly through Day 28.  Patients are encouraged to return for onsite visits at least weekly if possible; other follow-up visits may be conducted by telephone or home visits.  Patients should return to the site for a Day 28 visit.  After Day 28, all patients should have follow up visits on Day 35, Day 45, and Day 60; the Day 35 and Day 45 visits may be conducted by telephone or by home visits for discharged patients, while the Day 60 visit should be conducted onsite.</p>\n<p>During the study, standard supportive care will be given according to clinical practice.</p>\n<p></p></div>",

However, approximately 20% require hospitalization due to more severe disease.  A study of 138 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 published on 7 February 2020 found that 26% of patients admitted to hospital required transfer to the intensive care unit (ICU) and 4.3% died; however, given that a number of patients were still hospitalized at the time of this report, this number may be an underestimate (Wang et al. 2020).  A previous study had found that out of 41 admitted hospital patients, 13 (32%) were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died (Huang et al. 2020).  A more recent study with 1099 patients indicated that 16% of patients developed a severe form of disease, 5% were admitted to an ICU, 2.3% underwent invasive mechanical ventilation, and 1.4% died (Guan et al. 2020).</p>\n<p>Given the significant unmet need in patients hospitalized with severe COVID-19, and based on the emerging evidence for TCZ use in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, this study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of TCZ in this population.

Avoid colloquialisms and abbreviations.</p>\n<p>Only one adverse event term should be recorded in the event field on the Adverse Event eCRF.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Diagnosis versus Signs and Symptoms</p>\n<p>A diagnosis (if known) should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF rather than individual signs and symptoms (e.g., record only liver failure or hepatitis rather than jaundice, asterixis, and elevated transaminases).  However, if a constellation of signs and/or symptoms cannot be medically characterized as a single diagnosis or syndrome at the time of reporting, each individual event should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF.  If a diagnosis is subsequently established, all previously reported adverse events based on signs and symptoms should be nullified and replaced by one adverse event report based on the single diagnosis, with a starting date that corresponds to the starting date of the first symptom of the eventual diagnosis.</p>\n<p>Adverse Events That Are Secondary to Other Events</p>\n<p>In general, adverse events that are secondary to other events (e.g., cascade events or clinical sequelae) should be identified by their primary cause, with the exception of severe or serious secondary events.  A medically significant secondary adverse event that is separated in time from the initiating event should be recorded as an independent event on the Adverse Event eCRF.  For example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\u2022\tIf vomiting results in mild dehydration with no additional treatment in a healthy adult, only vomiting should be reported on the eCRF.</li>\n<li>\u2022\tIf vomiting results in severe dehydration, both events should be reported separately on the eCRF.</li>\n<li>\u2022\tIf a severe gastrointestinal hemorrhage leads to renal failure, both events should be reported separately on the eCRF.</li>\n<li>\u2022\tIf dizziness leads to a fall and consequent fracture, all three events should be reported separately on the eCRF.</li>\n<li>\u2022\tIf neutropenia is accompanied by an infection, both events should be reported separately on the eCRF.</li>\n</ul>\n<p></p>\n<p>All adverse events should be recorded separately on the Adverse Event eCRF if it is unclear as to whether the events are associated.</p>\n<p>Persistent or Recurrent Adverse Events</p>\n<p>A persistent adverse event is one that extends continuously, without resolution, between patient evaluation timepoints.  Such events should only be recorded once on the Adverse Event eCRF.  The initial severity (intensity or grade) of the event will be recorded at the time the event is first reported.  If a persistent adverse event becomes more severe, the most extreme severity should also be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF.  If the event becomes serious, it should be reported to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning that the event became serious; see Section 5.4.2 for reporting instructions).  The Adverse Event eCRF should be updated by changing the event from \"non-serious\" to \"serious,\" providing the date that the event became serious, and completing all data fields related to serious adverse events.</p>\n<p>A recurrent adverse event is one that resolves between patient evaluation timepoints and subsequently recurs.  Each recurrence of an adverse event should be recorded as a separate event on the Adverse Event eCRF.</p>\n<p>Abnormal Laboratory Values</p>\n<p>Not every laboratory abnormality qualifies as an adverse event.  A laboratory test result must be reported as an adverse event if it meets any of the following criteria:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\u2022\tIs accompanied by clinical symptoms</li>\n<li>\u2022\tResults in a change in study treatment (e.g., dosage modification, treatment interruption, or treatment discontinuation)</li>\n<li>\u2022\tResults in a medical intervention (e.g., potassium supplementation for hypokalemia) or a change in concomitant therapy</li>\n<li>\u2022\tIs clinically significant in the investigator's judgment </li>\n</ul>\n<p></p>\n<p>It is the investigator's responsibility to review all laboratory findings.  Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether an isolated laboratory abnormality should be classified as an adverse event.</p>\n<p>If a clinically significant laboratory abnormality is a sign of a disease or syndrome (e.g., alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin 5 \uf0b4 ULN associated with cholestasis), only the diagnosis (i.e., cholestasis) should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF.</p>\n<p>If a clinically significant laboratory abnormality is not a sign of a disease or syndrome, the abnormality itself should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, along with a descriptor indicating whether the test result is above or below the normal range (e.g., \"elevated potassium,\" as opposed to \"abnormal potassium\").  If the laboratory abnormality can be characterized by a precise clinical term per standard definitions, the clinical term should be recorded as the adverse event.  For example, an elevated serum potassium level of 7.0 mEq/L should be recorded as \"hyperkalemia.\"</p>\n<p>Observations of the same clinically significant laboratory abnormality from visit to visit should only be recorded once on the Adverse Event eCRF (see Section for details on recording persistent adverse events).</p>\n<p>5.3.5.5\tAbnormal Vital Sign Values</p>\n<p>Not every vital sign abnormality qualifies as an adverse event.  A vital sign result must be reported as an adverse event if it meets any of the following criteria:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\u2022\tIs accompanied by clinical symptoms</li>\n<li>\u2022\tResults in a change in study treatment (e.g., dosage modification, treatment interruption, or treatment discontinuation)</li>\n<li>\u2022\tResults in a medical intervention or a change in concomitant therapy</li>\n<li>\u2022\tIs clinically significant in the investigator's judgment </li>\n</ul>\n<p></p>\n<p>It is the investigator's responsibility to review all vital sign findings.  Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether an isolated vital sign abnormality should be classified as an adverse event.</p>\n<p>If a clinically significant vital sign abnormality is a sign of a disease or syndrome (e.g., high blood pressure), only the diagnosis (i.e., hypertension) should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF.</p>\n<p>Observations of the same clinically significant vital sign abnormality from visit to visit should only be recorded once on the Adverse Event eCRF (see Section 5.3.5.3 for details on recording persistent adverse events).</p>\n<p>Abnormal Liver Function Tests</p>\n<p>The finding of an elevated ALT or AST (\uf03e 3 \uf0b4 ULN) in combination with either an elevated total bilirubin (\uf03e 2 \uf0b4 ULN) or clinical jaundice in the absence of cholestasis or other causes of hyperbilirubinemia is considered to be an indicator of severe liver injury (as defined by Hy's Law).  Therefore, investigators must report as an adverse event the occurrence of either of the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\u2022\tTreatment-emergent ALT or AST \uf03e 3 \uf0b4 ULN in combination with total bilirubin \uf03e 2 \uf0b4 ULN</li>\n<li>\u2022\tTreatment-emergent ALT or AST \uf03e 3 \uf0b4 ULN in combination with clinical jaundice</li>\n</ul>\n<p></p>\n<p>The most appropriate diagnosis or (if a diagnosis cannot be established) the abnormal laboratory values should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF (see Section 5.3.5.1) and reported to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event), either as a serious adverse event or an adverse event of special interest (see Section 5.4.2).</p>\n<p>Deaths</p>\n<p>All deaths that occur during the protocol-specified adverse event reporting period (see Section 5.3.1), regardless of relationship to study drug, must be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF and immediately reported to the Sponsor (see Section 5.4.2).  This includes death attributed to progression of COVID-19 pneumonia.</p>\n<p>Death should be considered an outcome and not a distinct event.  The event or condition that caused or contributed to the fatal outcome should be recorded as the single medical concept on the Adverse Event eCRF.  Generally, only one such event should be reported.  If the cause of death is unknown and cannot be ascertained at the time of reporting, \"unexplained death\" should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF.  If the cause of death later becomes available (e.g., after autopsy), \"unexplained death\" should be replaced by the established cause of death.  The term \"sudden death\" should not be used unless combined with the presumed cause of death (e.g., \"sudden cardiac death\").</p>\n<p>If the death is attributed solely to progression of COVID-19 pneumonia, \"COVID-19 pneumonia progression\" should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF.</p>\n<p>Deaths that occur after the adverse event reporting period should be reported as described in Section 5.6.</p>\n<p>Preexisting Medical Conditions</p>\n<p>A preexisting medical condition is one that is present at the screening visit for this study.  Such conditions should be recorded on the General Medical History and Baseline Conditions eCRF.</p>\n<p>A preexisting medical condition should be recorded as an adverse event only if the frequency, severity, or character of the condition worsens during the study.  When recording such events on the Adverse Event eCRF, it is important to convey the concept that the preexisting condition has changed by including applicable descriptors (e.g., \"more frequent headaches\").</p>\n<p>Lack of Efficacy or Worsening of COVID-19 Pneumonia</p>\n<p>Events that are clearly consistent with the expected pattern of progression of the underlying disease should not be recorded as adverse events (with the exception of death due to COVID-19 pneumonia progression as described in Section 5.3.5.7).  These data will be captured as efficacy assessment data only.  If there is any uncertainty as to whether an event is due to disease progression, it should be reported as an adverse event.</p>\n<p>Hospitalization or Prolonged Hospitalization</p>\n<p>Any adverse event that results in hospitalization (i.e., inpatient admission to a hospital) or prolonged hospitalization should be documented and reported as a serious adverse event (per the definition of serious adverse event in Section 5.2.2), except as outlined below.</p>\n<p>An event that leads to hospitalization under the following circumstances should not be reported as an adverse event or a serious adverse event:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\u2022\tHospitalization for respite care</li>\n<li>\u2022\tHospitalization for a preexisting condition, provided that all of the following criteria are met:</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The hospitalization was planned prior to the study or was scheduled during the study when elective surgery became necessary because of the expected normal progression of the disease</p>\n<p>The patient has not experienced an adverse event</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>An event that leads to hospitalization under the following circumstances is not considered to be a serious adverse event, but should be reported as an adverse event instead:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\u2022\tHospitalization that was necessary because of patient requirement for outpatient care outside of normal outpatient clinic operating hours</li>\n</ul>\n<p></p>\n<p>Cases of Accidental Overdose or Medication Error</p>\n<p>Accidental overdose and medication error (hereafter collectively referred to as \"special situations\"), are defined as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\u2022\tAccidental overdose:  accidental administration of a drug in a quantity that is higher than the assigned dose</li>\n<li>\u2022\tMedication error:  accidental deviation in the administration of a drug </li>\n</ul>\n<p>In some cases, a medication error may be intercepted prior to administration of the drug.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Special situations are not in themselves adverse events, but may result in adverse events.  Each adverse event associated with a special situation should be recorded separately on the Adverse Event eCRF.  If the associated adverse event fulfills seriousness criteria, the event should be reported to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event; see Section 5.4.2).  For TCZ (or matching placebo), adverse events associated with special situations should be recorded as described below for each situation:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\u2022\tAccidental overdose:  Enter the adverse event term.  Check the \"Accidental overdose\" and \"Medication error\" boxes.</li>\n<li>\u2022\tMedication error that does not qualify as an overdose:  Enter the adverse event term.  Check the \"Medication error\" box.</li>\n<li>\u2022\tMedication error that qualifies as an overdose:  Enter the adverse event term.  Check the \"Accidental overdose\" and \"Medication error\" boxes.</li>\n</ul>\n<p></p>\n<p>In addition, all special situations associated with TCZ (or matching placebo), regardless of whether they result in an adverse event, should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF as described below:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\u2022\tAccidental overdose:  Enter the drug name and \"accidental overdose\" as the event term.  Check the \"Accidental overdose\" and \"Medication error\" boxes.</li>\n<li>\u2022\tMedication error that does not qualify as an overdose:  Enter the name of the drug administered and a description of the error (e.g., wrong dose administered, wrong dosing schedule, incorrect route of administration, wrong drug, expired drug administered) as the event term.  Check the \"Medication error\" box.</li>\n<li>\u2022\tMedication error that qualifies as an overdose:  Enter the drug name and \"accidental overdose\" as the event term.  Check the \"Accidental overdose\" and \"Medication error\" boxes.  Enter a description of the error in the additional case details.</li>\n<li>\u2022\tIntercepted medication error:  Enter the drug name and \"intercepted medication error\" as the event term.  Check the \"Medication error\" box.  Enter a description of the error in the additional case details.</li>\n</ul>\n<p></p>\n<p>As an example, an accidental overdose that resulted in a headache would require two entries on the Adverse Event eCRF, one entry to report the accidental overdose and one entry to report the headache.  The \"Accidental overdose\" and \"Medication error\" boxes would need to be checked for both entries.</p>\n<p>Safety Biomarker Data</p>\n<p>Adverse event reports will not be derived from safety biomarker data by the Sponsor, and safety biomarker data will not be included in the formal safety analyses for this study.  In addition, safety biomarker data will not inform decisions on patient management.</p></div>",

Changes to the protocol, along with a rationale for each change, are summarized below:</p><ul> <li>\uf0b7 An additional secondary efficacy endpoint of time to recovery was added to facilitate comparison with other trials of treatments for COVID-19 (Sections 2.1.2 and 6.4.2).</li> <li>\uf0b7 Text on the sample size and power calculation was updated to incorporate the increased enrollment target to maintain 90% power for the primary endpoint, as described in the SAP (Sections 3.1, 4.1, 6.1, 9.5).  The potential for an increase in enrollment was included in Version 2 of the protocol, and the confirmation of increased enrollment was communicated to sites, Agencies, and ethics committees in the week of 4 May 2020.</li> <li>\uf0b7 The geographic stratification factors were updated to address the inclusion of only North American and Europe because no sites outside of these regions were included in the study (Sections 3.1, 4.2.1, 6.1, 6.4.2).</li> <li>\uf0b7 Text on the reporting of pregnancies in partner of male patients was removed to align with the informed consent form and recommendations for tocilizumab in other indications (Section 5.4.3).</li> <li>\uf0b7 The method of analysis for the primary endpoint was updated to utilize a non-parametric method that was determined to be a more appropriate method, as described in the SAP (Sections 6.1 and 6.4.1).</li> <li>\uf0b7 The method of analysis for the secondary endpoint of clinical status at additional timepoints was updated to utilize a non-parametric method that was determined to be a more appropriate method, as described in the SAP (Section 6.4.2).</li> <li>\uf0b7 Selected secondary efficacy endpoints were specified as key secondary endpoints to address Type I error control, as described in the SAP (Section 6.4.2).</li> <li>\uf0b7 For clarity and as described in the SAP, language on the planned interim analyses was updated to address the increased enrollment target to maintain 90% power for the primary endpoint and the criteria for not conducting the interim analyses (Section 6.9).</li> </ul><p>Additional minor changes have been made to improve clarity and consistency. Substantive new information appears in italics.  This amendment represents cumulative changes to the original protocol.</p></div>",

The approved dose is 8 mg/kg for body weight \uf0b3 30kg and 12 mg/kg for body weight \uf03c 30 kg.

However, approximately 20% require hospitalization due to more severe disease.  A study of 138 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 published on 7 February 2020 found that 26% of patients admitted to hospital required transfer to the intensive care unit (ICU) and 4.3% died; however, given that a number of patients were still hospitalized at the time of this report, this number may be an underestimate (Wang et al. 2020).  A previous study had found that out of 41 admitted hospital patients, 13 (32%) were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died (Huang et al. 2020). A more recent study with 1099 patients indicated that 16% of patients developed a severe form of disease, 5% were admitted to an ICU, 2.3% underwent invasive mechanical ventilation, and 1.4% died (Guan et al. 2020).</p><p>Given the significant unmet need in patients hospitalized with severe COVID-19, and based on the emerging evidence for TCZ use in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, this study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of TCZ in this population.
