        "rationale": "<p>Nasal glucagon (LY900018) is a powder formulation of human glucagon for the rescue treatment of hypoglycemia packaged\n  in a user-friendly, single-use, nasal dosing device that delivers 3 mg glucagon powder for absorption through the\n  nasal mucosa. The glucagon component of LY900018 is a synthetic single-chain, 29-amino-acid polypeptide identical to\n  human glucagon. LY900018 is being developed for the rescue treatment of hypoglycemia.</p>\n<p>Currently, glucagon in a liquid form lacks physical and chemical stability; thus, marketed products require\n  reconstitution of glucagon powder before the product can be administered through intramuscular (IM) injection.\n  LY900018 combines stable, synthetic glucagon and a nasal dosing device that for effective use obviates reconstitution,\n  injection, and moreover, patient inhalation. Because of these advantages, LY900018 may offer a significant improvement\n  in the treatment of severe hypoglycemia occurring outside of the hospital setting.</p>\n<p>The aim of this study is to compare LY900018 with IM glucagon (IMG), a currently approved product that requires\n  reconstitution prior to administration through IM injection, in Japanese patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM)\n  and patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) who achieve treatment success during controlled insulin-induced\n  hypoglycemia. Treatment success is defined as an increase in plasma glucose (PG) to \u226570 mg/dL or an increase of \u226520\n  mg/dL from the PG nadir within 30 minutes after receiving glucagon, without the patient receiving additional\n  treatments to increase PG. The nadir is defined as the minimum PG measurement at the time of or within 10 minutes\n  following glucagon administration.</p>",

              "text": "<div><p>Hypoglycemia is a common complication in all patients with T1DM and some patients with T2DM who use insulin to reduce blood glucose levels. Use of sulfonylurea and glinide by patients with T2DM may also cause hypoglycemia. Depending on the severity, hypoglycemia causes physical symptoms ranging from weakness, dizziness, and sweating progressing to blurred vision, behavioral changes, progressing to unconsciousness, seizures, and coma, and possibly to death (American Diabetes Association 2017). When emergency services are available in a timely manner, intravenous (IV) glucose supplementation is also an effective treatment. Glucagon for injection is a globally available product currently indicated for the treatment of severe hypoglycemia, and is another important treatment option outside of a clinical setting for people who try to rescue patients with severe hypoglycemia. However, for people without enough medical training, the multi-step reconstitution of glucagon and injection procedure would be complex and daunting with substantial risk of errors (Polonsky et al. 2016). Therefore the needle-free and easy-to-administer formulation of glucagon is desired for patients who have a risk of severe hypoglycemia related to anti-diabetes treatments. LY900018 is a powder formulation of synthetic human glucagon in a user-friendly, single-use, nasal dosing</p>\n<p>device which delivers 3 mg glucagon powder. Patients do not need to inhale, as the drug is absorbed from the nasal cavity.</p>\n<p>Three clinical trials using LY900018 have been completed in non-Japanese adults with T1DM and T2DM: Study IGBC, Study I8R-MC-IGBA (IGBA), and an actual use study (Study I8R-MC-B002 [B002]). Studies IGBC and IGBA demonstrated comparable safety and efficacy between 3 mg LY900018 and 1 mg injectable glucagon in reversing insulin-induced hypoglycemia in adult patients with T1DM only (Study IGBA) or patients with T2DM and T1DM (IGBC). Study B002 was an actual use study that evaluated the effectiveness of 3 mg LY900018 administered by a trained caregiver to patients with T1DM experiencing moderate to severe hypoglycemia in a real-world environment of work and home. Study B002 demonstrated that 96% of moderate to severe hypoglycemic events were resolved within 30 minutes. Finally, 2 trials were conducted in pediatric patients with T1DM: Study I8R-MC-IGBB (IGBB) and Study I8R-MC-B001 (B001). Studies IGBB and B001 demonstrated effectiveness in rescuing pediatric patients from hypoglycemia.</p>\n<p>All adult diabetic patients in the 2 inpatient clinical trials (Studies IGBA and IGBC) underwent hypoglycemia induction through IV insulin under close clinical supervision and were administered either LY900018 or injectable glucagon.</p>\n<p>Patients fully recovered from hypoglycemia without additional actions to increase glucose level. Specifically, in Study IGBC, at 30 minutes after glucagon dosing, 98.7% (74 out of 75 patients) of LY900018 and 100% (75 out of 75) of IMG-treated patients achieved treatment success (defined as an increase in PG to &gt;70 mg/dL or an increase of &gt;20 mg/dL from nadir). The nadir is defined as the minimum glucose measurement at the time of or within 10 minutes following glucagon administration. The LY900018-treated patient who did not meet the above criteria did achieve both PG &gt;70 mg/dL and an increase of &gt;20 mg/dL from nadir at 40 minutes after dosing. Furthermore, the mean time to treatment success in participants with nadir glucose &lt;50 mg/dL were 16 minutes in the LY900018 treatment arm and 13 minutes in the IMG treatment arm, respectively (Rickels et al. 2016).</p></div>",

              "text": "<div><p>This study design involves an open-label assessment of 3 mg LY900018 compared to 1 mg of the marketed IMG (GlucaGen). The study will be open label because the different administration routes (ie, intranasal and IM) cannot be blinded. The use of a crossover design allows each patient to serve as his or her own control, thereby reducing variability. The washout period of 3 to 14 days is considered sufficient based on the short half-life of LY900018 (t 1/2 = approximately 25 minutes). Since the critical role of glucagon in the treatment of severe hypoglycemia is to raise the PG level sufficiently to restore cognition to the point where oral carbohydrate can be ingested, treatment success is defined either as an increase in PG returning to normal level of \u226570 mg/dL or an increase of \u226520 mg/dL from the PG nadir within 30 minutes after receiving glucagon, without the patient receiving additional actions to increase glucose. It is believed that an expected PG nadir of approximately 50 mg/dL (approximately 5 minutes after stop of insulin infusion at 60 mg/dL) is low enough to generate clinical symptoms in most participants and is high enough to avoid impairment of consciousness. The primary analysis includes both patients with T1DM and T2DM since it is expected that the proportion of treatment success is similar between patients with T1DM and T2DM.</p></div>",

Plasma glucose\n  measurements may not be available during such an event, but neurological recovery attributable to the restoration of\n  PG concentration to normal is considered sufficient evidence that the event was induced by a low PG concentration (PG\n  \u226470 mg/dL).</p>\n<p><b>Other Hypoglycemia</b></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p><i>Nocturnal hypoglycemia:</i>Any documented hypoglycemic event (including severe hypoglycemia) that occurs at\n      night and presumably during sleep.

This definition\n      is more useful than the commonly used approximately 00:00 to 06:00 definition which does not take patients'\n      individual sleep times into consideration, and is consistent with the American Diabetes Association recommendations of\n      reporting events that occur during sleep (ADA 2005). It is also important to collect the actual time when a hypoglycemic\n      event occurred to allow further characterization of hypoglycemia timing (eg, to allow analysis of frequency of events\n      occurring across a 24-hour clock). Nocturnal hypoglycemia may occur at severity Levels 1, 2, or 3.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><i>Relative hypoglycemia (also referred to as pseudohypoglycemia [Seaquist et al. 2013]):</i> An event during which\n      typical symptoms of hypoglycemia occur, that does not require the assistance of another person and is accompanied by PG\n      &gt;70 mg/dL. The PG value of patients with chronically poor glycemic control can decrease so rapidly that patients may\n      report symptoms of hypoglycemia before their PG concentration falls below 70 mg/dL. Events with PG \u226470 mg/dL\n      should not be categorized as relative hypoglycemia. Evaluation and statistical analysis of this category is optional.\n      However, if a patient reports a relative hypoglycemia event where assistance from another person was received or\n      the patient experienced significant symptoms, the study team\n      should clarify the circumstances to ensure the event is not a severe hypoglycemia event, and report it\n      appropriately.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><i>Probable symptomatic hypoglycemia:</i> Symptoms of hypoglycemia were present, but PG measurement was not reported.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><i>Overall (or total) hypoglycemia:</i> This optional category combines most cases of hypoglycemia (documented\n      hypoglycemia\n      and probable symptomatic hypoglycemia, including severe hypoglycemia). It does not include relative hypoglycemia.\n      Nocturnal and severe hypoglycemia are special cases of documented or probable hypoglycemia. If an event of\n      hypoglycemia falls into multiple subcategories, that event should only be counted once in the category of overall\n      (or total) hypoglycemia.</p>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Hypoglycemia episodes will be recorded on specific CRF pages. Only severe hypoglycemic episodes will be reported\n  separately as AEs. If a hypoglycemic event meets the criteria of severe, it needs to be recorded as serious in the CRF\n  (that is, recorded as an SAE). In the case of a hypoglycemic event (other than severe), the actual glucose value, if\n  measured, should be recorded in the CRF, with any treatments administered, and not be recorded as an AE. Cases of\n  hypoglycemia may be treated with foods rich in carbohydrate such as fruit, juice, skimmed milk, or energy bars. All\n  episodes of hypoglycemia that are determined by the investigator to constitute severe hypoglycemia according to the\n  definition above should be reported as SAEs.</p></div>",
