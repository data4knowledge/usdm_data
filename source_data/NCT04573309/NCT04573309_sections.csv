<p>PROTOCOL AMENDMENT SUMMARY OF CHANGES TABLE</p>
<p><b>Amendment 3.1 (US), 18 Mar 2022</b></p>
<p>This amendment is considered to be substantial based on the criteria set forth in Article 10(a) of Directive 2001/20/EC of the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union, the US Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) regulation at 21 CFR part 312.30(b), and any applicable local regulations.</p>
<p><b>Overall Rationale for the Amendment</b></p>
<p>The main reason for preparation of this amendment was to clarify study procedures occurring across different sites in the US, so as to facilitate participant recruitment across different regions of the US, and to lessen inconvenience for participants without compromising the quality of the study.</p>
<p><b>Changes to the Protocol</b></p>
<p><b>Section # and Name Description of Change Brief Rationale and/or Clarifications</b></p>
<p>Section 1.3 Schedule of Activities (SoA), Table 1</p>
<p>Addition of text to the footnote to state that procedures specific to screening sites (only in the US) detailed in Section 8</p>
<p>As per Section 8 (below).</p>
<p>4.2 Scientific Rationale for Study Design</p>
<p>Number of days changed from 30 days to 21 days in the following sentence:</p>
<p>• However, the physiologic turnover of</p>
<p>human gastrointestinal epithelial cells is 3 - 5 days (Darwich, 2014); therefore, the inhibitory effect of zinc on intestinal copper absorption is expected to be minimal 30 <b>21</b> days after discontinuation of zinc.</p>
<p>To align the number of days with the mention of zinc discontinuation elsewhere in the protocol.</p>
<p>Section 8 Study Assessments and Procedures</p>
<p>Addition of text applicable only to the US that details the possibility for sites in the US to only perform screening procedures and not any of the remaining study procedures.</p>
<p>To facilitate participant recruitment across different regions of the US and to lessen inconvenience for participants without compromising the quality of the study.</p>

1.,,PROTOCOL SUMMARY,
1.1.,,Synopsis,"<p>ALXN1840-WD-204</p>
<p><b>Protocol Title:</b> A Phase 2, Open-label Study to Assess Copper and Molybdenum Balance in Participants with Wilson Disease Treated with ALXN1840 <b>Short Title:</b> Copper and Molybdenum Balance in Participants with Wilson Disease Treated with ALXN1840</p>
<p><b>Rationale:</b></p>
<p>The principal aim of this exploratory study is to investigate the effects of ALXN1840 on copper balance in participants with Wilson disease (WD). The study will specifically evaluate the effects of 2 different ALXN1840 doses as well as the duration of treatment on copper balance to further elucidate the dose response of “decoppering” versus “maintenance” dose in participants with WD.</p>
<p>The secondary aim of the study is to characterize the steady-state absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME; mass balance) of total molybdenum which is a surrogate measure of ALXN1840 disposition in participants with WD.</p>
<p>ALXN1840 contains the active anion tetrathiomolybdate and has been shown to cause negative copper balance when administered to healthy animals as well as decopper the liver in animal models of WD. In Study WTX101-201, which assessed the safety and efficacy of ALXN1840 in participants with WD, ALXN1840 demonstrated enhanced copper control as measured by reduced plasma non-ceruloplasmin-bound copper (NCC) corrected (NCCc<span class=""s11"">o</span><span class=""s12"">rr</span>ec<span class=""s13"">t</span>e<span class=""s11"">d</span> ) for the stable tetrathiomolybdate- copper -albumin tripartite complex (TPC).</p>
<p>Depletion of copper by ALXN1840 has been shown to occur primarily through fecal elimination in both healthy and WD animal models. In this study, copper balance will be calculated as the difference between measured copper input in food and drink and measured copper output in urine and feces. This method is classically considered the most objective measure of decoppering ability with a decoppering agent able to drive a net negative copper balance.</p>
<p>As part of the secondary objective, to confirm that ALXN1840 steady state is adequately characterized by the plasma pharmacokinetics (PK), a molybdenum mass balance assessment will be performed at predicted steady state for the 15 mg/day and 30 mg/day doses: if steady state is achieved, molybdenum(out) will equal molybdenum(in). This approach may also detect potential accumulation in the liver or other tissues of participants with WD.</p>

<p>Note: The accumulation period refers to time from initiation of ALXN1840 (Day 1) to expected steady state at Day 10, based on 5 times the half-life of 2 days.</p>
<p><b>Overall Design</b> This is a single-arm, open-label, repeat-dose study to evaluate the effects of ALXN1840 administration on copper balance in participants with WD. The safety and tolerability of ALXN1840 in participants with WD will also be assessed. ALXN1840 PK in plasma as measured via total molybdenum and plasma ultrafiltrate (PUF) molybdenum will be determined after repeated dosing along with total molybdenum mass balance at steady state.</p>
<p><b>Disclosure Statement</b>: This is an open-label, 3-period study with 1 arm. <b>Number of Participants:</b></p>
<p>The sample size will be approximately 10 participants which will allow a general characterization of copper balance in response to ALXN1840.</p>
<p><span class=""s16""><b>N</b></span><span class=""s17""><b>ot</b></span><span class=""s18""><b>e</b></span><span class=""s17"">:</span> “Enrolled” means all participants who sign the informed consent form (ICF), are eligible for the study, and are registered on Day -7 when participants are assigned a participant number.</p>
<p><b>Intervention Groups and Duration:</b></p>
<p>Treatment-experienced (which includes standard of care therapies or ALXN1840) and treatment-naïve participants are eligible for this study. Following screening and enrollment, participants will have a Run-in Period to support diet equilibration (Day -7 through Day -5) and measurement of pretreatment copper and molybdenum balance (Day -4 through Day -1). Following the Run-in Period, participants will be administered ALXN1840 at 15 mg/day for a treatment period of approximately 28 days followed by titration up to 30 mg/day on Day 29. Before titration to 30 mg/day, the Safety Review Committee (SRC) will review available safety data through Day 23 for each participant.</p>
<p>Participants will have intake and output collection periods from Day -4 through Day -1, from Day 1 through Day 8 (initial 15 mg/day collection period), and Day 25 through Day 39. The collection periods will support an assessment of both copper and molybdenum balance (as a measure of ALXN1840 ADME) at the 15 mg/day and 30 mg/day doses and will allow assessment of the effects of duration of treatment on copper elimination and copper balance.</p>
<p>Participants may be discharged from the clinical research unit (CRU) on Day 9 to return on Day 22 or Day 23 (predose); all procedures will start on Day 23. To ensure flexibility, the Outpatient Period during Treatment Period 1 may be extended up to an additional 14 days with Investigator approval. In this situation, participants will be given additional investigational product to support daily dosing throughout the Outpatient Period. In such cases, the actual Outpatient Period</p>

2.,,INTRODUCTION,"<p>ALXN1840-WD-204</p>
<p>ALXN1840 (bis-choline tetrathiomolybdate; formerly known as WTX101) is a novel copper binding agent in development for the treatment of WD.</p>"
2.1.,,Study Rationale,"<p>The principal aim of this exploratory study is to investigate the effects of ALXN1840 on copper balance in participants with WD. The study will specifically evaluate the effects of 2 different ALXN1840 dose levels as well as the duration of treatment on copper balance to further elucidate the dose response of “decoppering” versus “maintenance” dose in participants with WD.</p>
<p>ALXN1840 contains the active anion tetrathiomolybdate and has been shown to cause negative copper balance when administered to healthy animals as well as decopper the liver in animal models of WD (Mills, 1981; Czachor, 2002). In Study WTX101-201, which assessed the safety and efficacy of ALXN1840 in participants with WD, ALXN1840 demonstrated enhanced copper control as measured by reduced plasma NCCc<span class=""s11"">o</span><span class=""s12"">rr</span>ec<span class=""s13"">t</span>e<span class=""s11"">d</span> for the stable tetrathiomolybdatecopper-albumin TPC (Weiss, 2017).</p>
<p>Depletion of copper by ALXN1840 has been shown to occur primarily through fecal elimination in both healthy and WD animal models. Sheep injected with 30 mg/day of tetrathiomolybdate for 5 days were shown to have an elevation of fecal copper during the treatment period increasing from a baseline of approximately 3 mg/day up to approximately 7 mg/day during the treatment period, before returning to baseline concentrations (Mason, 1988). Similarly, when Long-Evans Cinnamon (LEC) WD model rats were injected intraperitoneally with a saline solution of tetrathiomolybdate at a dose of 10 mg/kg body weight for 8 consecutive days, the amounts of both copper and molybdenum excreted into the feces increased significantly (Ogra, 2000), which may suggest that copper is excreted in a complex with tetrathiomolybdate into the feces. While fecal copper increases with tetrathiomolybdate, the amount of copper excreted into the urine decreased and that of molybdenum increased significantly during treatment with tetrathiomolybdate. Molybdenum in the urine was molybdate which does not bind copper (data on file). These findings are in line with other studies showing enhanced biliary and/or fecal excretion of copper and molybdenum upon administration of tetrathiomolybdate in rats and sheep (Komatsu, 2000; Ogra, 1995; Mason, 1988).</p>
<p>We hypothesize that repeated doses of ALXN1840 may drive a net negative copper balance in participants with WD by increasing fecal excretion of copper. In this study, copper balance will be calculated as the difference between measured copper input in food and drink and measured copper output in urine and feces. This method is classically considered the most objective measure of decoppering ability with a decoppering agent able to drive a net negative copper balance (Hill,1986; Strickland, 1971; Walshe, 1973). The purpose of this study is to provide additional descriptive characterization of the effect of ALXN1840 on copper balance in participants with WD. Further data obtained may help support characterization of a “decoppering” versus “maintenance” dose of ALXN1840, where a decoppering dose would be a dose sufficient to drive a net negative copper balance and maintenance would support a more neutral copper balance.</p>

<p>The secondary aim of the study is to characterize the steady-state ADME (mass balance) of total molybdenum as a surrogate measure of ALXN1840 disposition in participants with WD. To confirm that steady state is adequately characterized by the plasma PK, a molybdenum mass balance assessment will be performed on Day 25 through Day 28 for the 15 mg/day dose and Day 36 through Day 39 for the 30 mg/day dose: if steady state is achieved, molybdenum(out) will equal molybdenum(in).</p>
<p><b>2.2. Background</b></p>
<p>ALXN1840 has been selected for development in WD due to its improved stability properties over ammonium tetrathiomolybdate, which has previously been studied in participants with WD and other indications. Ammonium tetrathiomolybdate and bis-choline tetrathiomolybdate nonclinical and clinical data reported to date support the efficacy and safety of ALXN1840.</p>
<p>ALXN1840 rapidly forms stable tetrathiomolybdate-copper-albumin TPCs, which stabilize free copper leading to a reduction in the NCC concentrations after correction for free copper bound to TPC (NCCc<span class=""s11"">o</span><span class=""s12"">rr</span>ec<span class=""s13"">t</span>e<span class=""s11"">d</span> ).</p>
<p>Studies in both healthy and WD animal models showed that treatment with tetrathiomolybdate results in removal of copper from the liver. Tetrathiomolybdate administered to healthy mice by intraperitoneal injection resulted in a dose-dependent reduction in liver copper concentration over a treatment range of 0 - 6 mg/kg/day (human equivalent dose [HED] by body surface area [BSA] scaling: 0 - 1 mg/kg/day). The results of these studies indicated that only 30% ‑ 40% of copper remained after 5 weeks of treatment. Similar liver decoppering (approximately 40% - 60%) was also reported in toxic milk mice (a WD animal model) at 5 mg/kg/ day for 14 days (HED by BSA scaling: 0.4 mg/kg/day; Mills, 1981; Czachor, 2002). In LEC WD model rats, 25 mg/kg/day of ALXN1840 (HED by BSA scaling: 4 mg/kg/day) administered by oral gavage for 10 days, resulted in an approximately 50% decrease in liver copper concentration. Because ALXN1840 has been shown to have a similar mechanism of action in healthy and WD animal models, a mechanism of action study in healthy participants is being performed (Study ALXN1840-HV-108) to demonstrate that ALXN1840 can result in a change from baseline in copper balance with repeat-dose ALXN1840 (30 mg/day) treatment.</p>
<p>In the Phase 2 proof-of-concept Study WTX101-201 in participants with WD, ALXN1840 demonstrated a sustained control of free copper as measured by NCCc<span class=""s11"">o</span><span class=""s12"">rr</span>ec<span class=""s13"">t</span>e<span class=""s11"">d</span> . Importantly, ALXN1840 treatment resulted in improvements in disability and neurologic symptoms as measured by the Unified Wilson Disease Rating Scale (UWDRS, Parts II and III) and stabilization of liver function (Weiss, 2017). Treatment with ALXN1840 resulted in an acceptable safety and tolerability profile when initiated at 15 mg daily with Investigator-driven, individual participant titration of dose based on safety, NCCc<span class=""s11"">o</span><span class=""s12"">rr</span>ec<span class=""s13"">t</span>e<span class=""s11"">d</span> , and symptoms.</p>
<p>Following single-dose administration of 60 mg ALXN1840, total molybdenum peaked at approximately 4.54 hours with a terminal elimination half-life measured at approximately 51 hours. In Study WTX101-201, the PK of ALXN1840, based on total molybdenum, indicated that exposure in participants with WD at a dose of 30 mg appeared consistent with previous results from healthy participants. The half-life was estimated to be approximately 24 hours at steady state on Days 84 and 168 and was shorter than estimated in previous studies. Based on a total molybdenum PK half-life of approximately 24 - 51 hours, total molybdenum steady state may conservatively be reached within approximately 10 - 12 days. Nevertheless, results (as</p>
<p> 
Alexion Confidential</p>
<p>Protocol Amendment 3.1 (US) 18 Mar 2022</p>
<p>ALXN1840-WD-204</p>
<p>measured by total molybdenum) obtained from the ALXN1840 balance study in the LEC WD rat model suggested that approximately 30% of a single dose of ALXN1840 remained in the liver by Day 7, indicating the possibility of tissue accumulation, particularly in the setting of high liver copper concentration (Plitz, 2019).</p>
<p>If the half-life of ALXN1840 in liver were longer than that of the systemic compartment, the accumulation may not be readily detected in the absence of a longer treatment period and with characterization of the terminal elimination period. An alternative approach to assessing steady state using total molybdenum PK is to assess whether the total molybdenum intake is equal to the total molybdenum output; this approach may detect any significant ongoing accumulation in the liver or other tissues.</p>

<p><b>2.3.2. Benefit Assessment</b></p>
<p>The main objective of effective WD treatment is to provide:</p>
<p>ALXN1840-WD-204</p>
<p>• Rapid and sustained control of copper and mitigation of clinical symptoms of WD 
through the formation of a stable tetrathiomolybdate-copper-albumin TPC. Copper 
control may prevent tissue toxicity, including neurological deterioration that has been 
reported at the initiation of treatment with chelators. This hypothesis is supported by 
results from Study WTX101-201 in participants with WD (Weiss, 2017).</p>
<p>• Improved compliance over current chelator therapy through improved tolerability and the 
convenience of a simplified dosing regimen (once daily) compared to current therapeutic 
options (multiple daily dosing). 
Potential benefits of study participation for participants include:</p>
<p>• Participation in a clinical study increases the participant's understanding of the 
pathophysiology and treatment of WD.</p>
<p>• Removal of total body copper as a definitive treatment for WD.</p>
<p>• Participants in the study will contribute to improved care for other participants with WD 
in the future.</p>
<p><b>2.3.3. Overall Benefit-Risk Conclusion</b></p>
<p>Taking into account the measures implemented to minimize risk to participants in this study, the potential risks identified in association with ALXN1840 are justified by the anticipated benefits that may be afforded to participants with WD.</p>

4.,,STUDY DESIGN Overall Design 4.1.,"<p>ALXN1840-WD-204</p>
<p>This study will be conducted as an open-label, repeat-dose study to evaluate the effects of ALXN1840 on copper balance in participants with WD.</p>
<p>Treatment-experienced (which includes standard of care therapies or ALXN1840) and treatment-naïve participants are eligible for this study. Eligible patients will be classified into one of two cohorts:</p>
<p>• Cohort 1 (treatment experienced): Patients who have received WD therapy for &gt; 28 days</p>
<p class=""p8"">• Cohort 2 (treatment naïve): Patients who have received WD therapy for ≤ 28 days</p>
<p>Following screening and enrollment, participants will check-in to the CRU on Day -8 for the Run-in Period. The purpose of the Run-in Period is to support diet equilibration (Day -7 through Day -5) and measure pretreatment copper and molybdenum balance (Day -4 through Day -1). Participants will remain on a copper/molybdenum-controlled diet throughout both the Inpatient Period 1 (Day -8 to Day 9) and Inpatient Period 2 (Day 23 to Day 40). While not in the CRU, participants will be encouraged to adhere to their usual copper-controlled diet.</p>
<p>Participants who are taking copper-chelating therapies (penicillamine or trientine) at the time of enrollment will be discontinued from their decoppering therapies starting on Day -4 to allow a baseline assessment of copper/molybdenum balance prior to ALXN1840 treatment. On Day 1, participants will be initiated on 15 mg/day of ALXN1840 for a treatment period of approximately 28 days followed by titration up to 30 mg/day on Day 29. Before titration to 30 mg/day, the SRC will review available safety data through Day 23 for each participant.</p>
<p>Participants will have intake and output collection periods from Day -4 through Day -1, from Day 1 through Day 8, and Day 25 through Day 39. The collection periods will support an assessment of both copper and molybdenum balance (as a measure of ALXN1840 ADME) at the 15 mg and 30 mg doses and will allow assessment of the effects of duration of treatment on copper elimination and copper balance.</p>
<p>Collection periods for feces and urine will vary in duration from 3 to 15 days to support assessment of both copper and molybdenum balance before and at steady state for both 15 mg and 30 mg. Equilibration periods on copper/molybdenum-controlled diets will be a minimum of 48 hours. Copper balance will be calculated as the mean daily copper balance over each of the 4 collection periods. The interpretation of copper balance will be based on the criteria established by Hill,1986 when undertaking copper balance studies with zinc treatment. For assessment of ALXN1840 effect on copper balance, the time period for analysis will take into consideration the average bowel transit of approximately 40 hours (male: 33 hours; female: 47 hours) (Camilleri, 1986; Metcalf, 1987).</p>
<p>Throughout the inpatient periods, participants will remain on a copper-controlled diet. Meal portions will be weighed, and meal sizes will be appropriate to support male and female caloric consumption. Participants will be encouraged to complete 100% of all meals throughout the inpatient period to support quantification of copper and molybdenum intake. If participants are unable to complete the full meal, the uneaten portion will be weighed to allow calculation of meal fraction, and copper and molybdenum intake will be adjusted based on the fractional intake</p>

<p>of the meal. In addition to food, fluid intake and type will be measured and recorded each day. Samples of all meals and fluids will be sent for bioanalysis to support accurate quantification of copper and molybdenum in fluids. In the event that items cannot be accurately quantified, items may be balanced during pretreatment period and post-treatment period to support the change from baseline assessment.</p>
<p>During the inpatient collection periods, daily urine will be pooled (24-hour collection) with volumes recorded for each 24-hour period; participants will be strongly encouraged to void within 2 hours of completion of each 24-hour period (ie, dosing time). Stool samples will be individually collected and each sample will include a collection date, time, and weight.</p>
<p>Participants may be discharged from the CRU on Day 9 and return on Day 22 or Day 23 (predose); all procedures will start on Day 23. To ensure flexibility, the Outpatient Period during Treatment Period 1 may be extended up to an additional 14 days with Investigator approval. In this situation, participants will be given additional investigational product to support daily dosing throughout the Outpatient Period. In such cases, the actual Outpatient Period duration will be recorded and the participant will continue Inpatient Period 2 at Day 23. During the Outpatient Period, participants will use SMS text messaging to confirm study intervention administration. At the CRU's discretion, participants may remain in the CRU during the outpatient period for safety or to maintain the integrity of the conduct of the study.</p>
<p>Blood sampling for PK/pharmacodynamic (PD) will occur over the 24-hour dosing period on Days 1, 25, 29, and 39. Predose PK samples will be collected at all time points during the intake and output collection period to help characterize PK during accumulation (Days 1 through 9 for 15 mg and Days 31 through 35 for 30 mg) and at steady state (Days 25 through 28 for 15 mg and Days 36 through 39 for 30 mg).</p>
<p>This study incorporates the use of an adaptive design. Adaptive features may be implemented at the discretion of the Investigator to support conduct of the study. Such adaptive features do not require amendment of the protocol. Adaptive features and their limits are described in Table 4.</p>

4.2.,,Scientific Rationale for Study Design,"<p>The study is designed as an open-label exploratory study to provide a descriptive assessment of copper balance in participants with WD, the target population for ALXN1840 therapy. The study is being conducted as a repeat-dose study to assess the effect of duration of ALXN1840 treatment and the effects of intra-patient dose increase on copper and molybdenum balance in participants with WD. The intra-patient dose escalation schedule is similar to that employed in the current Phase 3 Study WTX101-301. The similar schedule was chosen to characterize the decoppering effects expected early with treatment. This study is designed to supplement the mechanism of action study in healthy participants (Study ALXN1840-HV-108). While healthy participants are expected to be adequate to assess the mechanism of action of ALXN1840, characterization of copper balance in the WD population will help to understand if there are differences in the magnitude of effect between the 2 populations as this may be important to understand the doses that may support a net neutral versus a net negative copper balance. Limited nonclinical data on copper elimination with tetrathiomolybdate suggested copper excretion may be at least maintained or increased with repeated dosing (refer to the current IB).</p>
<p> 
Alexion Confidential</p>
<p>Protocol Amendment 3.1 (US) 18 Mar 2022</p>
<p>ALXN1840-WD-204</p>
<p>Therefore, the duration of the study and multiple collection periods will better characterize the pattern of copper elimination over time. Such information may be helpful in understanding the decoppering and maintenance phases.</p>
<p>As the study involves intensive diet control and sampling, the study is planned to be conducted in a small number of participants with WD who will be admitted to a CRU for 2 inpatient periods. Inpatient Period 1 includes a baseline and initial 15 mg/day collection period during the accumulation phase followed by an Outpatient Period; Inpatient Period 2 with a second collection period to support analysis of copper balance at 15 mg/day steady state and a 30 mg/day accumulation and steady state.</p>
<p>During the Outpatient Period, participants will be encouraged to remain on a copper-controlled diet; however, to avoid confounding, a diet equilibration period is included in each study period. Overall, collection periods are a minimum of 3 days and as long as 15 days (which will be subdivided for analyses). Collection periods of at least 3 days were used to help minimize the impact of day-to-day variability on measurements. In addition, the time period for analysis will take into consideration the average bowel transit of approximately 40 hours (male: 33 hours; female: 47 hours) (Camilleri, 1986; Metcalf, 1987). Because the periods are of different lengths, the study will calculate mean daily copper balance.</p>
<p>While the primary endpoint for the study is an assessment of net copper balance, measurement of a pretreatment copper baseline will be helpful to understand the magnitude of effect of ALXN1840. To assess the copper baseline during the Inpatient Run-in Period, participants will be discontinued from their chelator therapy for approximately 4 days prior to initiating ALXN1840. During this period, participants will be maintained on a copper-controlled diet to minimize risk to the participants. In the Phase 3 study ALXN1840-WD-301, participants discontinue their chelator approximately 48 hours prior to initiation of ALXN1840 without reported complications. Among participants who discontinue chelator due to intolerance or noncompliance, the time from chelator discontinuation to the onset or worsening of symptoms varies from as little as 1 or 2 weeks to as long as months or years (Scheinberg, 1987). To prevent confounding of the study results, participants must be off zinc therapy for a minimum of 21 days prior to Day 1 because zinc works through upregulation of metallothionein (MT) in enterocytes resulting in elevation of fecal copper excretion. Previously, reports in the literature suggest that it can take up to 3 weeks or longer for zinc treatment to have an efficacious effect on copper balance (Brewer, 1983), so a delayed time to reversal of this effect could also occur. However, the physiologic turnover of human gastrointestinal epithelial cells is 3 - 5 days (Darwich, 2014); therefore, the inhibitory effect of zinc on intestinal copper absorption is expected to be minimal 21 days after discontinuation of zinc.</p>
<p>Following ALXN1840 administration, the active drug moiety tetrathiomolybdate rapidly binds copper to form TPC, mostly in the liver and blood, and presents as such in the systemic circulation. If TPC is not rapidly formed, tetrathiomolybdate spontaneously undergoes serial hydrolysis to form molybdate, the most common form of nutrient molybdenum, and is excreted in the urine. Total molybdenum concentration has been measured as a surrogate of ALXN1840 PK; however, total molybdenum concentration cannot distinguish whether the molybdenum is protein bound (mostly as TPC), free active drug as ALXN1840, intermediate hydrolysis products, or molybdate. To better characterize the amount of non-TPC-bound drug and its unbound degradation products, plasma PUF-molybdenum has also been measured, which</p>
<p> 
Alexion Confidential</p>
<p>Protocol Amendment 3.1 (US) 18 Mar 2022</p>
<p>ALXN1840-WD-204</p>
<p>represents the free parent drug (ALXN1840), short-lived intermediate hydrolysis products, and molybdate, which may have originated from the tetrathiomolybdate or from food intake as a micronutrient. Total molybdenum PK and free molybdenum PK serve as surrogate measures of ALXN1840 PK. To better characterize the ADME of ALXN1840, the PK of both total molybdenum and PUF-molybdenum will be characterized and described.</p>
<p>This study is designed to provide an extensive assessment of copper and molybdenum balance over the first 40 days of treatment with ALXN1840 and support a more robust understanding of the effects of duration of treatment and dose of ALXN1840 on copper balance. Half-life estimates for total molybdenum in Study WTX101-201 were reported to be approximately 24 hours at steady state on Days 84 and 168, while in healthy participants, total molybdenum half-life was measured closer to 51 hours. With a half-life within this range, the sample collection periods include assessment of copper and molybdenum balance both during accumulation and at steady state for both the 15 mg/day and 30 mg/day doses. The study will include both intake and output collection as well as PK and copper assessments (ie, ceruloplasmin-bound copper and labile bound copper [LBC]) to inform the relationship between balance measurements and copper and molybdenum levels in the blood.</p>
<p>Finally, preclinical data from ALXN1840 ADME study suggest the potential for molybdenum accumulation in the liver of participants with WD; therefore, an assessment of molybdenum balance will help determine whether steady state has been reached as defined by a molybdenum balance of neutral during the collection period. Because molybdenum is a necessary micronutrient and serves as a cofactor for a number of enzymes and may exist in intracellular stores, small variations in molybdenum balance could be due to molybdate rather than ALXN1840.</p>

4.3.,,Justification for Dose,"<p>ALXN1840 at 60 mg single dose has been shown to have an adequate safety profile and be well-tolerated in healthy male and female participants in the Phase 1 bioavailability Studies WTX101-101 and WTX101-102. In addition, preliminary data from Study WTX101-106 have also shown ALXN1840 to be well tolerated in healthy Japanese and non-Japanese male and female participants at a single dose of 15 mg or 60 mg. While no repeat-dose studies have been performed in healthy participants, bis-choline tetrathiomolybdate (ALXN1840) has been tested in a range of oncologic indications with a maximum tolerated dose of 300 mg/day (Lowndes, 2008).</p>
<p>In the Phase 2 Study WTX101-201 conducted in participants with WD, the daily ALXN1840 doses were 15 mg for 6 (21%) participants, 30 mg for 13 (46%) participants, and 60 mg (32%) for 9 participants at Week 24 when the primary endpoint assessment was conducted, or at the last dose received for participants with early discontinuation. The 15 to 60 mg/day dose range has been demonstrated to be efficacious with a favorable safety profile in treating participants with WD (Weiss, 2017). Based on these Phase 2 study results, the ongoing Phase 3 Study WTX101-301 in participants with WD has been testing the efficacy and safety of ALXN1840 at</p>
<p>

<p>ALXN1840-WD-204</p>
<p>a dose titration range from 15 mg to 60 mg daily with data to date supporting an acceptable safety profile.</p>
<p>Similar to the Phase 2 study, in Study WTX101-301, participants are started at a dose of 15 mg/day and, after review of all safety information, participants may be titrated up to 30 mg/day after approximately 4 weeks. Based on the results of Study WTX101-201, doses ranging from 15 mg/day to 60 mg/day were adequate to significantly decrease non-ceruloplasmin corrected copper concentrations corrected for TPC (NCCc<span class=""s11"">o</span><span class=""s12"">rr</span>ec<span class=""s13"">t</span>e<span class=""s11"">d</span> ) and, in many cases, return the NCC to normal concentrations of copper control. Given the robust improvement in copper control, it is hypothesized that doses within the 15 to 30 mg/day range will be adequate to drive a net negative copper balance. The current study will explore copper balance in response to treatment with ALXN1840, with the purpose of informing the dose and dosing duration required to result in adequate copper elimination to drive a measurable net negative copper balance. Copper balance will be assessed for the 15 mg/day dose at the beginning and end of the 15 mg/day treatment period, and at the beginning of the 30 mg/day treatment period. Copper balance will be assessed for the 30 mg/day dose at Days 31 through 35 and Days 36 through 39. The multiple collection periods will support assessment of duration of treatment and dose on copper elimination and overall copper balance.</p>
<p>In this study, dosing for ALXN1840 will be initiated at 15 mg once daily for a minimum of 4 weeks, with an increase to 30 mg after 4 weeks, unless there are safety concerns that, in the opinion of the Investigator(s) and/or Alexion, may place participants at undue risk, in which case, participants may remain on the 15 mg/day dose for the duration of the study.

<p>Discontinuation of Study Intervention</p>
<p>In rare instances, it may be necessary for a participant to permanently discontinue (definitive discontinuation) the study intervention. If the study intervention is definitively discontinued, the participant should remain in the study to be evaluated for safety follow-up. See the Schedule of Activities (SoA, Section 1.3) for data to be collected at the time of discontinuation of study intervention and follow-up and for any further evaluations that need to be completed.</p>
<p>Discontinuation of study intervention for abnormal liver function should be considered by the Investigator when a participant meets one of the conditions outlined in the Dose Modification criteria (Section 6.6) or if the Investigator believes that it is in best interest of the participant.</p>
<p>If a clinically significant finding is identified (including, but not limited to changes from baseline in QT interval corrected using Fridericia's formula [QTcF]) after enrollment, the Investigator or qualified designee will determine if the participant can continue in the study and if any change in participant management is needed. This review of the ECG printed at the time of collection must be documented. Any new clinically relevant finding should be reported as an AE.</p>
<p>Participants must be considered for discontinuation from study intervention if any of the following occur during the study:</p>
<p>• Serious hypersensitivity reaction;</p>
<p>• Severe uncontrolled infection;</p>
<p>• Use of disallowed medication;</p>
<p>• Pregnancy or planned pregnancy (see Section 8.2.6); or</p>

participation prior to conducting the screening procedures. The study staff should 
notify Alexion and their site monitor of all study withdrawals as soon as possible. The 
reason for participant discontinuation must be recorded in the source documents and 
CRF.</p>
<p>• A participant may withdraw from the study at any time at his/her own request, or may 
be withdrawn at any time at the discretion of the Investigator for safety, behavioral, 
compliance, or administrative reasons.</p>
<p>• At the time of discontinuation from the study, if possible, an early discontinuation 
visit should be conducted, as shown in the SoA. See SoA (Section 1.3) for data to be

<p>• The site must attempt to contact the participant and reschedule the missed visit as 
soon as possible and counsel the participant on the importance of maintaining the 
assigned visit schedule and ascertain whether or not the participant wishes to and/or 
should continue in the study.</p>
<p>• Before a participant is deemed lost to follow-up, the Investigator or designee must 
make every effort to regain contact with the participant (where possible, 3 telephone 
calls and, if necessary, a certified letter to the participant's last known mailing 
address or local equivalent methods). These contact attempts should be documented

8.2.,,Safety Assessments,"<p>Planned time points for all safety assessments are provided in the SoA (Section 1.3).</p>
<p>When multiple procedures are scheduled to occur at the same time, the following order of events should be strictly adhered to whenever possible: ECG, vital signs, blood sampling, study intervention administration, and meal.</p>
<p>Pharmacokinetic collection should occur as close as possible to the scheduled time.</p>
<p>All routine safety laboratory samples should be drawn following a minimum of 8 hours fasting.</p>
<p><b>8.2.1. Physical Examinations</b></p>
<p>• A complete physical examination will include, at a minimum, assessments of the 
cardiovascular, respiratory, gastrointestinal, and neurological systems. Height (at 
Screening only) and weight (as per the SoA for physical examinations) will also be 
measured and recorded. A symptom-driven physical examination may be performed at 
other times, at the Principal Investigator's discretion. 
<b>8.2.2. Vital Signs</b></p>
<p>• Body temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, and systolic and diastolic blood pressure 
(mm Hg) will be assessed using consistent methods and equipment to allow 
comparability and reproducibility throughout the study.</p>
<p>• Blood pressure and heart rate measurements will be assessed with a completely 
automated device. Manual techniques will be used only if an automated device is not 
available.</p>

<p>Protocol Amendment 3.1 (US) 18 Mar 2022</p>
<p>ALXN1840-WD-204</p>
<p>• Blood pressure and heart rate measurements should be preceded by at least 5 minutes of 
rest for the participant in a quiet setting without distractions (eg, television, cell phones). 
Ideally, the same arm for each participant should be used for measurements.</p>
<p>• Vital signs will be measured in a supine position after 5 minutes rest and will include 
temperature, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and heart rate. Vital signs will consist 
of a single pulse and blood pressure measurement. If vital signs are abnormal as defined 
by inclusion/ exclusion criteria, 2 additional vital signs measurements will be made. The 
average of the 3 vital signs measurements will be recorded in the CRF and used to 
determine participant eligibility. The average of the blood pressure readings will be 
recorded in the CRF. 
<b>8.2.3. Electrocardiograms</b></p>
<p>• Triplicate 12-lead ECGs will be conducted as outlined in the SoA (see Section 1.3) to 
obtain heart rate, PR, QRS, QT, and QTc intervals. Refer to Section 7 for QTc 
withdrawal criteria and any additional QTc readings that may be necessary. As with vital 
signs, if ECG interval measurements are abnormal, an additional triplicate will be 
performed and recorded in the CRF. 
<b>8.2.4. Clinical Safety Laboratory Assessments</b></p>
<p>• See Section 10.2 for the list of clinical laboratory tests to be performed and to the SoA 
(Section 1.3) for the timing and frequency.</p>
<p>• The Investigator must review the laboratory report, document this review, and record any 
clinically relevant changes occurring during the study in the AE section of the CRF. The 
laboratory reports must be filed with the source documents. Clinically significant 
laboratory values are those deemed by the Investigator to be clinically significant 
resulting in further evaluation or treatment or those associated with an AE or clinical 
signs or symptoms.</p>
<p>• All laboratory tests with values considered abnormal and clinically significant during 
participation in the study or after the last dose of study intervention should be repeated 
until the values return to normal or baseline or are no longer considered clinically 
significant by the Investigator or Medical Monitor.</p>

<p><b>8.2.4.1 . Bowel and Urine Monitoring</b></p>
<p>ALXN1840-WD-204</p>
<p>Participant's bowel movements and urination will be monitored by the clinical staff. The clinical staff will record in the CRF each time a fecal and urine sample is collected. All urine and feces must be collected from Day -4 through Day -1, Day 1 through Day 8, Day 25 through Day 39.</p>
<p><b>8.2.4.2 . Intake Monitoring</b></p>
<p>To support accurate quantification of copper/molybdenum intake, each participant's intake including both food and fluids will be monitored and recorded. Following each standardized meal, the clinical staff will record 100% completion of each meal including all liquids. If a participant is unable to eat 100% of the food for a given meal, the remaining food will be weighed and reported in the CRF to support accurate determination of copper/molybdenum as a fraction of the total meal. Similarly, if participants do not complete 100% of non-water fluids with meal, the remaining volume will be measured and recorded in the CRF. In the case of water intake, the staff will record daily water volume intake in the CRF.</p>
<p><b>8.2.5. Suicidal Ideation and Behavior Risk Monitoring</b></p>
<p>Suicidal ideation and behavioral changes will be recorded as adverse events and may, at the discretion of the Investigator, result in withdrawal of the participation from the study and urgent referral for psychiatric treatment.</p>
<p><b>8.2.6. Pregnancy</b></p>
<p>• Pregnancy data from female participants and female spouses/partners of male participants 
will be collected from the signing of the ICF and at the time points specified in the SoA. 
Any female participant who becomes pregnant while participating in the study will be 
discontinued from the study intervention. If a pregnancy is reported, the Investigator must 
immediately inform Alexion within 24 hours of awareness of the pregnancy and follow 
the procedures outlined in Section 10.4.</p>
<p>• For all Alexion products, both in development or post approval, exposure during 
pregnancy must be recorded and the pregnancy followed, until the outcome of the 
pregnancy is known (ie, spontaneous miscarriage, elective termination, normal birth, or 
congenital abnormality), even if the participant discontinues the study intervention or 
withdraws from the study. The corresponding infant must be followed for 3 months 
postpartum.</p>
<p>• Pregnancy is not considered as an AE (Section 10.4) unless there is a suspicion that the 
study intervention may have interfered with the effectiveness of a contraceptive 
medication. However, complications of pregnancy and abnormal outcomes of pregnancy 
are AEs and may meet the criteria for an SAE (eg, ectopic pregnancy, spontaneous 
abortion, intrauterine fetal demise, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly) (Section 8.3). 
Elective abortions without complications should not be reported as AEs.</p>"
8.3.,,Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events,"<p>The definitions of AEs and SAEs can be found in Section 10.3.</p>

Alexion Confidential</p>
<p>Protocol Amendment 3.1 (US) 18 Mar 2022</p>
<p>ALXN1840-WD-204</p>
<p>All AEs will be reported to the Investigator or qualified designee by the participant (or, when appropriate, by a caregiver, surrogate, or the participant's legally authorized representative).</p>
<p>The Investigator and any qualified designees are responsible for detecting, documenting, and recording events that meet the definition of an AE or SAE and remain responsible for following up AEs that are serious, considered related to the study intervention or study procedures, or that caused the participant to discontinue the study intervention (see Section 7).</p>
<p>Procedures for recording, evaluating, follow-up, and reporting AEs and SAEs are outlined in Section 10.3.</p>
<p><b>8.3.1. Time Period and Frequency for Collecting AE and SAE Information</b></p>
<p>All AEs and SAEs will be collected from the signing of the ICF until the EOS Visit.</p>
<p>All SAEs will be recorded and reported to Alexion or the designee immediately and under no circumstance should this exceed 24 hours, as indicated in Section 10.3. The Investigator will submit any updated SAE data to Alexion within 24 hours of it being available.</p>
<p>Investigators are not obligated to actively seek AE or SAE data after conclusion of the study participation. However, if the Investigator learns of any SAE, including a death, at any time after a participant has been discharged from the study, and he/she considers the event to be reasonably related to the study intervention or study participation, the Investigator must promptly notify Alexion.</p>
<p><b>8.3.2. Method of Detecting AEs and SAEs</b></p>
<p>The method of recording, evaluating, and assessing causality of AE and SAE and the procedures for completing and transmitting SAE reports are provided in Section 10.3.</p>
<p>Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting AEs and/or SAEs. Open-ended and non-leading verbal questioning of the participant is the preferred method to inquire about AE occurrences.</p>
<p><b>8.3.3. Follow-up of AEs and SAEs</b></p>
<p>After the initial AE/SAE report, the Investigator is required to proactively follow up on each participant at subsequent visits/contacts. All SAEs will be followed up until resolution, stabilization, the event is otherwise explained, or the participant is lost to follow-up (as defined in Section 7.3). Further information on follow-up procedures is provided in Section 10.3.</p>
<p><b>8.3.4. Regulatory Reporting Requirements for SAEs</b></p>
<p>• Prompt notification of an SAE by the Investigator to Alexion is essential so that legal 
obligations and ethical responsibilities toward the safety of participants and the safety 
of a study intervention under clinical investigation are met.</p>
<p>• Alexion has a legal responsibility to notify both the local regulatory authority and 
other regulatory agencies about the safety of a study intervention under clinical 
investigation. Alexion will comply with country-specific regulatory requirements 
relating to safety reporting to the regulatory authority, Institutional Review Boards 
(IRBs)/ Independent Ethics Committees (IECs), and Investigators.</p>
<p> 
Alexion Confidential</p>
<p>Protocol Amendment 3.1 (US) 18 Mar 2022</p>
<p>ALXN1840-WD-204</p>
<p>• Suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSARs) must be reported 
according to local regulatory requirements and Alexion policy and forwarded to 
Investigators as necessary.</p>
<p>• An Investigator who receives an Investigator safety report describing an SAE or other 
specific safety information (eg, summary or listing of SAEs) from Alexion will 
review and then file it along with the IB and will notify the IRB/IEC, if appropriate 
according to local requirements. 
<b>8.3.5. Adverse Events of Special Interest</b> 
There are no adverse events of special interest for this study. 
<b>8.3.6. Retained and Biobanked Sample</b> 
A single biobanked serum sample will be collected predose from each participant to serve as a retained sample during the study. Samples will remain on site and will be discarded following the completion of the clinical study report. The sample will not be used for genetic testing (see Section 8.7).

For this study, any dose of ALXN1840 greater than that specified in the protocol will be considered an overdose. 
Alexion does not recommend specific treatment for an overdose. 
Overdoses are medication errors that are not considered AEs unless there is an untoward medical occurrence resulting from the overdose. 
In the event of an overdose or suspected overdose, the Investigator/treating physician should:</p>
<p>1. Contact the Medical Monitor immediately.</p>
<p>2. Closely monitor the participant for any AE/SAE.</p>
<p>3. Obtain a plasma sample for PK analysis if requested by the Medical Monitor (determined 
on a case-by-case basis).</p>
<p>4. Document the quantity of the excess dose as well as the duration of the overdose in the 
CRF. 
Decisions regarding dose interruptions or modifications will be made by the Investigator in consultation with the Medical Monitor based on the clinical evaluation of the participant.

<p>Analyses will be performed using the SAS® software Version 9.4 or higher.</p>
<p><b>9.4.1. Primary Analysis</b></p>
<p>The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate a net negative copper balance with daily repeat-dose ALXN1840 treatment (15 mg and 30 mg) in participants with WD.</p>
<p> 
Alexion Confidential</p>
<p>Protocol Amendment 3.1 (US) 18 Mar 2022</p>
<p>ALXN1840-WD-204</p>
<p>The primary analysis will be performed using the Full Analysis Set. Average daily copper balance and molybdenum balance will be calculated over the following periods:</p>
<p>1.</p>
<p>2.</p>
<p>3.</p>
<p>4.</p>
<p>5.</p>
<p>Day -4 through Day -1 representing predose baseline Days 1 through 8 representing the ALXN1840 15 mg/day accumulation period Days 25 through 28 representing the ALXN1840 15 mg/day steady-state period Days 31 through 35, representing the ALXN1840 30 mg/day accumulation period Days 36 through 39 representing the ALXN1840 30 mg/day steady-state period</p>
<p>As ALXN1840 is expected to increase copper excretion through fecal excretion, copper in stool will be critical for determining copper balance. Because stools can be irregular, assessment of copper and molybdenum balance will only include data up to the day of the final bowel movement. For example, for the period Day 1 through Day 8, if the final bowel movement occurs on Day 7, average daily copper balance for the Day 1 through Day 8 period will only include data from Day 1 through Day 7.</p>
<p>In the case of the 15 mg/day steady-state period (ie, Day 25 through Day 28), stool data collected on Days 29 - 30 samples may be used if needed to support assessments for the 15 mg/day dose. Use of these stool data (as needed) are consistent with an approximately 2-day gastrointestinal transit time.</p>
<p>In the case of stool irregularity, and to support assessment of copper output over time, bowel movement copper and molybdenum outputs may be averaged over the days between bowel movement (or start of study) to ensure an approximate value for each 24-hour period.</p>
<p><b>9.4.2. Secondary Analyses</b></p>
<p>Secondary analyses will be performed using the Full Analysis Set. The secondary continuous endpoints (including copper balance, molybdenum balance, and 24-hour urine excretion of copper and molybdenum) will be analyzed using the same methods described for the primary analysis.</p>
<p><b>9.4.3. Safety Analysis</b></p>
<p>Safety analyses will be performed using the Safety Analysis Set.</p>
<p>Safety analyses will include all AEs, ECGs, clinical laboratory data, physical examinations, and vital sign measurements using descriptive statistics.</p>
<p>No inferential statistical analyses are planned for the safety parameters of this study. The incidence of AEs and SAEs will be summarized by System Organ Class and Preferred Term for each treatment and overall, and by relationship to study intervention. Adverse events will also be summarized by treatment and overall by severity. Serious AEs and AEs resulting in withdrawal from the study will be listed. Participants having multiple AEs within a category (eg, overall, System Organ Class, Preferred Term) will be counted once in that category. For severity tables, a participant's most severe event within a category will be counted.</p>
<p>Changes from baseline in vital sign measurements and laboratory assessments (eg, chemistry, hematology, coagulation, and urinalysis) will be summarized by treatment. Laboratory parameter values will be graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE).

<p>• An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant, temporally associated with the use of study 
intervention, whether or not considered related to the study intervention.</p>
<p>• Note: An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory 
finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of study intervention .</p>

<p>• Any abnormal laboratory test results (hematology, clinical chemistry, or urinalysis) or other safety 
assessments (eg, ECG, radiological scans, vital signs measurements), including those that worsen from 
baseline, considered clinically significant in the medical and scientific judgment of the Investigator (ie, not 
related to progression of underlying disease).</p>
<p>• Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre-existing condition including either an increase in frequency 
and/or intensity of the condition.</p>
<p>• New conditions detected or diagnosed after study intervention administration even though it may have been 
present before the start of the study.</p>
<p>• Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected drug-drug interaction.</p>
<p>• Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study intervention or a 
concomitant medication. Overdose per se will not be reported as an AE/SAE unless it is an intentional 
overdose taken with possible suicidal/self-harming intent. Such overdoses should be reported regardless of 
sequelae.</p>
<p><b>Events</b> <span class=""s57""><b>N</b></span><span class=""s17""><b>ot</b></span> <b>Meeting the AE Definition</b></p>
<p>• Medical or surgical procedure (eg, endoscopy, appendectomy): The condition that leads to the procedure is 
the AE. Situations in which an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (eg, hospitalization for elective 
surgery if planned before the signing the ICF, admissions for social reasons or for convenience).</p>
<p>• Anticipated day-to-day fluctuations of pre-existing disease(s) or condition(s) present or detected at the start 
of the study that do not worsen.</p>
<p>• A medication error (including intentional misuse, abuse, and overdose of the product) or use other than what 
is defined in the protocol is not considered an AE unless there is an untoward medical occurrence as a result 
of a medication error.</p>
<p>• Cases of pregnancy that occur during maternal or paternal exposure to study intervention are to be reported 
within 24 hours of Investigator/site awareness. Data on fetal outcome and breastfeeding will be collected for 
regulatory reporting and safety evaluation.</p>
<p>• Any clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings or other abnormal safety assessments which are 
associated with the underlying disease, unless judged by the Investigator to be more severe than expected for 
the participant's condition.</p>

<p><b>10.3.2. Definition of SAE</b></p>
<p>ALXN1840-WD-204</p>
<p>If an event is not an AE per definition above, then it cannot be an SAE even if serious conditions are met (eg, hospitalization for signs/symptoms of the disease under study, death due to progression of disease).</p>
<p><b>An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose:</b></p>
<p><b>1. Results in death</b></p>
<p><b>2. Is life-threatening</b></p>
<p>The term “life-threatening” in the definition of “serious” refers to an event in which the participant was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event, which hypothetically might have caused death, if it was more severe.</p>
<p><b>3. Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization</b></p>
<p>In general, hospitalization signifies that the participant has been detained (usually involving at least an overnight stay) at the hospital or emergency ward for observation and/or treatment that would not have been appropriate in the physician's office or outpatient setting. Complications that occur during hospitalization are AEs. If a complication prolongs hospitalization or fulfills any other serious criteria, the event is serious. When in doubt as to whether “hospitalization” occurred or was necessary, the AE should be considered serious.</p>
<p>Hospitalization for elective treatment of a pre-existing condition that did not worsen from baseline is not considered an AE.</p>
<p><b>4. Results in persistent disability/incapacity</b></p>
<p>• The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person's ability to conduct normal life functions.</p>
<p>• This definition is not intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical significance such as 
uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma (eg, sprained ankle) 
which may interfere with or prevent everyday life functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption.</p>
<p><b>5. Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect</b></p>
<p><b>6. Other situations:</b></p>
<p>• Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether SAE reporting is appropriate in other 
situations such as important medical events that may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or 
hospitalization but may jeopardize the participant or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 
one of the other outcomes listed in the above definition. These events should usually be considered serious.</p>
<p>• Examples of such events include invasive or malignant cancers, intensive treatment in an emergency room or 
at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization, or 
development of drug dependency or drug abuse.</p>
<p><b>A suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction (SUSAR) is defined as:</b></p>
<p>A serious event that is not listed in the Reference Safety Information of the Investigator's Brochure and that the Investigator or Sponsor identifies as related to investigational product or procedure. United States Title 21 CFR 312.32 and European Union Clinical Trial Directive 2001/20/EC and the associated detailed guidances or national regulatory requirements in participating countries require the reporting of SUSARs. Alexion has procedures that will be followed for the recording and expedited reporting of SUSARs that are consistent with global regulations and the associated detailed guidances. Suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions will be reported to the national competent authority and IRBs/IECs where applicable.</p>
<p><b>10.3.3. Recording and Follow-Up of AE and/or SAE</b></p>
<p><b>Recording of AE and/or SAE</b></p>
<p>• When an AE/SAE occurs, it is the responsibility of the Investigator to review all documentation (eg, hospital 
progress notes, laboratory reports, and diagnostics reports) related to the event.</p>
<p>• The Investigator will then record all relevant AE/SAE information in the CRF.</p>
<p>• It is not acceptable for the Investigator to send photocopies of the participant's medical records to Alexion 
in lieu of completion of the AE/SAE CRF page.</p>

<p><b>Recording of AE and/or SAE</b></p>
<p>ALXN1840-WD-204</p>
<p>• There may be instances when copies of medical records for certain cases are requested by Alexion. In this 
case, all participant identifiers, with the exception of the participant number, will be redacted on the copies 
of the medical records before submission to Alexion.</p>
<p>• The Investigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, symptoms, and/or other 
clinical information. Whenever possible, the diagnosis (not the individual signs/symptoms) will be 
documented as the AE/SAE.</p>
<p><b>Assessment of Severity</b> 
The Investigator will make an assessment of severity for each AE and SAE reported during the study and assign 
it to one of the following categories from National Cancer Institute CTCAE v5.0, published 27 Nov 2017:</p>
<p>• Grade 1: Mild (awareness of sign or symptom, but easily tolerated)</p>
<p>• Grade 2: Moderate (discomfort sufficient to cause interference with normal activities)</p>
<p>• Grade 3: Severe (incapacitating, with inability to perform normal activities)</p>
<p>• Grade 4: Life-threatening</p>
<p>• Grade 5: Fatal</p>
<p><b>Assessment of Causality</b> 
• The Investigator is obligated to assess the relationship between the study intervention and each occurrence of</p>
<p>each AE or SAE. An Investigator causality assessment must be provided for all AEs (both nonserious and</p>
<p>serious). This assessment must be recorded in the CRF and on any additional forms, as appropriate. The</p>
<p>definitions for the causality assessments are as follows:</p>
<p>− Not related: There is no reasonable possibility the study intervention caused the AE.</p>
<p>• The AE has a more likely alternative etiology; it may be due to underlying or 
concurrent illness, complications, concurrent treatments, or effects of another 
concurrent drug.</p>
<p>• The event does not follow a reasonable temporal relationship to administration of the 
study intervention. 
− Related: There is a reasonable possibility the study intervention caused the AE.</p>
<p>• The AE has a temporal relationship to the administration of the study intervention.</p>
<p>• The event does not have a likely alternative etiology.</p>
<p>• The event corresponds with the known pharmaceutical profile of the study 
intervention.</p>
<p>• There is improvement on discontinuation and/or reappearance on rechallenge.</p>
<p>• The Investigator will use clinical judgment to determine the relationship.</p>
<p>• Alternative causes, such as underlying disease(s), concomitant therapy, and other risk factors, as well as the 
temporal relationship of the event to study intervention administration will be considered and investigated.</p>
<p>• The Investigator will also consult the IB and/or Product Information, for marketed products, in his/her 
assessment.</p>
<p>• For each AE/SAE, the Investigator <b>must</b> document in the medical notes that he/she has reviewed the 
AE/SAE and has provided an assessment of causality.</p>
<p>• There may be situations in which an SAE has occurred, and the Investigator has minimal information to 
include in the initial report to Alexion. However, it is very important that the Investigator always make an 
assessment of causality for every event before the initial transmission of the SAE data to Alexion.</p>

<p>• The Investigator may change his/her opinion of causality in light of follow-up information and send an SAE 
follow-up report with the updated causality assessment.</p>
<p>• The causality assessment is one of the criteria used when determining regulatory reporting requirements.</p>
<p><b>Follow-up of AEs and SAEs</b></p>
<p>• The Investigator is obligated to perform or arrange for the conduct of supplemental measurements and/or 
evaluations as medically indicated or as requested by Alexion to elucidate the nature and/or causality of the 
AE or SAE as fully as possible. This may include additional laboratory tests or investigations, 
histopathological examinations, or consultation with other health care professionals.</p>
<p>• If a participant dies during participation in the study or during a recognized follow-up period, the Investigator 
will provide Alexion with a copy of any post-mortem findings including histopathology.</p>
<p>• New or updated information will be recorded in the originally completed CRF.</p>
<p>• The Investigator will submit any updated SAE data to Alexion within 24 hours of receipt of the information.

<p><b>CONTRACEPTIVESa ALLOWED DURING THE STUDY INCLUDE: Highly Effective Methodsb That Have Low User Dependency</b></p>
<p>• Implantable progestogen-only hormone contraception associated with inhibition of ovulationc</p>
<p>• Intrauterine device (IUD): female participants with a copper-containing IUD are excluded from study</p>
<p>• Intrauterine hormone-releasing system (IUS)c</p>
<p>• Bilateral tubal occlusion</p>
<p>• Vasectomized partner 
<span class=""s59"">o</span> Vasectomy is a highly effective contraceptive method provided that the partner is the sole sexual 
partner of the woman of childbearing potential and the absence of sperm has been confirmed. If not, an 
additional highly effective method of contraception should be used. Spermatogenesis cycle is 
approximately 90 days.</p>
<p><b>Highly Effective Methodsb That Are User Dependent</b></p>
<p>• Combined (estrogen- and progestogen-containing) hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of 
ovulation 
<span class=""s59"">o</span> Oral 
<span class=""s59"">o</span> Injectable 
<span class=""s59"">o</span> Intravaginal

<p>• Progestogen-only hormone contraception associated with inhibition of ovulationc 
<span class=""s59"">o</span> Oral 
<span class=""s59"">o</span> Injectable</p>
<p>• Sexual abstinence 
<span class=""s59"">o</span> Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as refraining from 
heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study intervention. The 
reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the study and the 
preferred and usual lifestyle of the participant.</p>
<p>Female participants of non-childbearing potential are exempt from contraception requirements. Non-childbearing potential for female participants is defined as any of the following:</p>
<p>• Prior to first menses</p>
<p>• Postmenopausal, as documented by amenorrhea for at least 1 year prior to the Day 1 visit and 
follicle stimulating hormone serum levels consistent with postmenopausal status</p>
<p>• Permanent sterilization at least 6 weeks prior to the Day 1 visit:</p>
<p>− Hysteroscopic sterilization 
− Bilateral tubal ligation or bilateral salpingectomy 
− Hysterectomy 
<span class=""s60"">−</span> Bilateral oophorectomy 
Note: Periodic abstinence (calendar, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods), withdrawal (coitus interruptus), 
spermicides only, and lactational amenorrhea method (LAM) are not acceptable methods of contraception for this 
study. Male condom and female condom should not be used together (due to risk of failure with friction).</p>
<p>a 
Contraceptive use by men or women should be consistent with local regulations regarding the use of contraceptive 
methods for those participating in clinical studies.</p>
<p>b 
Failure rate of &lt; 1% per year when used consistently and correctly. Typical use failure rates differ from those 
when used consistently and correctly.</p>
<p>c 
If locally required, in accordance with Clinical Trial Facilitation Group (CTFG) guidelines, acceptable 
contraceptive methods are limited to those which inhibit ovulation as the primary mode of action.</p>

<p><b>10.4.2. Collection of Pregnancy Information</b></p>
<p>ALXN1840-WD-204</p>
<p>If a female participant or a male participant's female spouse/partner becomes pregnant after the first dose of ALXN1840 through 3 months after the end of systemic exposure of the study intervention, the Investigator must submit the “Pregnancy/Breastfeeding Reporting and Outcome Form” to Alexion Global Drug Safety (GDS) via fax or email (see Section 10.3 for contact information). When the outcome of the pregnancy becomes known, the form should be updated and submitted to Alexion GDS. If additional follow-up is required, the Investigator will be requested to provide the information.</p>
<p>Exposure of an infant to an Alexion product during breastfeeding must also be reported (via the “Pregnancy/Breastfeeding Reporting and Outcome Form”) and any AEs experienced by the infant must be reported to Alexion GDS or designee via email or facsimile (see Section 10.3 for contact information).</p>

10.5.,,COVID-19 Vaccine Risk Assessment,"<p>ALXN1840-WD-204</p>
<p>To date, following a review of the limited available COVID-19 vaccine data (eg, Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna, AstraZeneca), it is unlikely that the immune response to a COVID-19 vaccine will be diminished with concomitant ALXN1840 administration, based on ALXN1840's mechanism of action. There is currently no information available evaluating the safety or efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines in participants treated with ALXN1840.</p>
<p>Local and national guidelines should be consulted for recommendations related to COVID-19 vaccination. Alexion suggests that participants complete vaccination series before study participation, if feasible. The decision to allow COVID-19 vaccinated participants to continue in the study should be made by the investigator on a participant-by-participant basis.</p>
<p>The potential risks identified and mitigation measures put in place in light of the COVID-19 vaccination rollout are provided in Table 10.</p>

<p>Missing data due to appointments for COVID-19 vaccination or side effects of COVID-19 vaccine may impact study visit schedules and increase missed visits and/or participant study discontinuations, inadvertently resulting in missing data (eg, for protocol-specified procedures).</p>
<p>It will be important to capture specific information in the eCRF that explains the reason the data is missing (eg, missed study visits due to appointments for COVID-19 vaccination or side effects of COVID-19 vaccine).</p>
