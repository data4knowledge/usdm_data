<p>Protocol Title: A Phase 2, Open-label Study to Assess Copper and Molybdenum Balance in Participants with Wilson Disease Treated with ALXN1840 Short Title: Copper and Molybdenum Balance in Participants with Wilson Disease Treated with ALXN1840</p>
<p>Rationale:</p>
<p>The principal aim of this exploratory study is to investigate the effects of ALXN1840 on copper balance in participants with Wilson disease (WD). The study will specifically evaluate the effects of 2 different ALXN1840 doses as well as the duration of treatment on copper balance to further elucidate the dose response of “decoppering” versus “maintenance” dose in participants with WD.</p>
<p>The secondary aim of the study is to characterize the steady-state absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME; mass balance) of total molybdenum which is a surrogate measure of ALXN1840 disposition in participants with WD.</p>
<p>ALXN1840 contains the active anion tetrathiomolybdate and has been shown to cause negative copper balance when administered to healthy animals as well as decopper the liver in animal models of WD. In Study WTX101-201, which assessed the safety and efficacy of ALXN1840 in participants with WD, ALXN1840 demonstrated enhanced copper control as measured by reduced plasma non-ceruloplasmin-bound copper (NCC) corrected (NCCc<span class=""s11"">o</span><span class=""s12"">rr</span>ec<span class=""s13"">t</span>e<span class=""s11"">d</span> ) for the stable tetrathiomolybdate- copper -albumin tripartite complex (TPC).</p>
<p>Depletion of copper by ALXN1840 has been shown to occur primarily through fecal elimination in both healthy and WD animal models. In this study, copper balance will be calculated as the difference between measured copper input in food and drink and measured copper output in urine and feces. This method is classically considered the most objective measure of decoppering ability with a decoppering agent able to drive a net negative copper balance.</p>
<p>As part of the secondary objective, to confirm that ALXN1840 steady state is adequately characterized by the plasma pharmacokinetics (PK), a molybdenum mass balance assessment will be performed at predicted steady state for the 15 mg/day and 30 mg/day doses: if steady state is achieved, molybdenum(out) will equal molybdenum(in). This approach may also detect potential accumulation in the liver or other tissues of participants with WD.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Objectives and Endpoints</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Overall Design This is a single-arm, open-label, repeat-dose study to evaluate the effects of ALXN1840 administration on copper balance in participants with WD. The safety and tolerability of ALXN1840 in participants with WD will also be assessed. ALXN1840 PK in plasma as measured via total molybdenum and plasma ultrafiltrate (PUF) molybdenum will be determined after repeated dosing along with total molybdenum mass balance at steady state.</p>
<p>Disclosure Statemen<span class=""s14"">t</span>: This is an ope<span class=""s14"">n</span>-label, 3-period study with 1 arm. Number of Participants:</p>
<p>The sample size will be approximately 10 participants which will allow a general characterization of copper balance in response to ALXN1840.</p>
<p><span class=""s16"">N</span><span class=""s17"">ot</span><span class=""s18"">e</span><span class=""s17"">:</span> “Enrolled” means all participants who sign the informed consent form (ICF), are eligible for the study, and are registered on Day -7 when participants are assigned a participant number.</p>
<p>Intervention Groups and Duration:</p>
<p>Treatment-experienced (which includes standard of care therapies or ALXN1840) and treatment-naïve participants are eligible for this study. Following screening and enrollment, participants will have a Run-in Period to support diet equilibration (Day -7 through Day -5) and measurement of pretreatment copper and molybdenum balance (Day -4 through Day -1). Following the Run-in Period, participants will be administered ALXN1840 at 15 mg/day for a treatment period of approximately 28 days followed by titration up to 30 mg/day on Day 29. Before titration to 30 mg/day, the Safety Review Committee (SRC) will review available safety data through Day 23 for each participant.</p>
<p>Participants will have intake and output collection periods from Day -4 through Day -1, from Day 1 through Day 8 (initial 15 mg/day collection period), and Day 25 through Day 39. The collection periods will support an assessment of both copper and molybdenum balance (as a measure of ALXN1840 ADME) at the 15 mg/day and 30 mg/day doses and will allow assessment of the effects of duration of treatment on copper elimination and copper balance.</p>
<p>Participants may be discharged from the clinical research unit (CRU) on Day 9 to return on Day 22 or Day 23 (predose); all procedures will start on Day 23. To ensure flexibility, the Outpatient Period during Treatment Period 1 may be extended up to an additional 14 days with Investigator approval. In this situation, participants will be given additional investigational product to support daily dosing throughout the Outpatient Period. In such cases, the actual Outpatient Period</p>
<p> </p>
<p>duration will be recorded and the participant will continue Inpatient Period 2 at Day 23. During the Outpatient Period, participants will use SMS text messaging to confirm study intervention administration. At the CRU's discretion, participants may remain in the CRU during the outpatient period for safety or to maintain the integrity of the conduct of the study.</p>
<p>Safety Review Committee:</p>
<p>A Safety Review Committee (SRC), composed of a minimum of the Investigator, Alexion Medical Monitor, and Alexion Safety Physician, will meet at the end of 15 mg/day dosing to confirm proceeding to 30 mg/day and as necessary based on any emerging safety concerns.</p>

<p>ALXN1840 (bis-choline tetrathiomolybdate; formerly known as WTX101) is a novel copper binding agent in development for the treatment of WD.</p>
<p>The principal aim of this exploratory study is to investigate the effects of ALXN1840 on copper balance in participants with WD. The study will specifically evaluate the effects of 2 different ALXN1840 dose levels as well as the duration of treatment on copper balance to further elucidate the dose response of “decoppering” versus “maintenance” dose in participants with WD.</p>
<p>ALXN1840 contains the active anion tetrathiomolybdate and has been shown to cause negative copper balance when administered to healthy animals as well as decopper the liver in animal models of WD (Mills, 1981; Czachor, 2002). In Study WTX101-201, which assessed the safety and efficacy of ALXN1840 in participants with WD, ALXN1840 demonstrated enhanced copper control as measured by reduced plasma NCCc<span class=""s11"">o</span><span class=""s12"">rr</span>ec<span class=""s13"">t</span>e<span class=""s11"">d</span> for the stable tetrathiomolybdatecopper-albumin TPC (Weiss, 2017).</p>
<p>Depletion of copper by ALXN1840 has been shown to occur primarily through fecal elimination in both healthy and WD animal models. Sheep injected with 30 mg/day of tetrathiomolybdate for 5 days were shown to have an elevation of fecal copper during the treatment period increasing from a baseline of approximately 3 mg/day up to approximately 7 mg/day during the treatment period, before returning to baseline concentrations (Mason, 1988). Similarly, when Long-Evans Cinnamon (LEC) WD model rats were injected intraperitoneally with a saline solution of tetrathiomolybdate at a dose of 10 mg/kg body weight for 8 consecutive days, the amounts of both copper and molybdenum excreted into the feces increased significantly (Ogra, 2000), which may suggest that copper is excreted in a complex with tetrathiomolybdate into the feces. While fecal copper increases with tetrathiomolybdate, the amount of copper excreted into the urine decreased and that of molybdenum increased significantly during treatment with tetrathiomolybdate. Molybdenum in the urine was molybdate which does not bind copper (data on file). These findings are in line with other studies showing enhanced biliary and/or fecal excretion of copper and molybdenum upon administration of tetrathiomolybdate in rats and sheep (Komatsu, 2000; Ogra, 1995; Mason, 1988).</p>
<p>We hypothesize that repeated doses of ALXN1840 may drive a net negative copper balance in participants with WD by increasing fecal excretion of copper. In this study, copper balance will be calculated as the difference between measured copper input in food and drink and measured copper output in urine and feces. This method is classically considered the most objective measure of decoppering ability with a decoppering agent able to drive a net negative copper balance (Hill,1986; Strickland, 1971; Walshe, 1973). The purpose of this study is to provide additional descriptive characterization of the effect of ALXN1840 on copper balance in participants with WD. Further data obtained may help support characterization of a “decoppering” versus “maintenance” dose of ALXN1840, where a decoppering dose would be a dose sufficient to drive a net negative copper balance and maintenance would support a more neutral copper balance.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The secondary aim of the study is to characterize the steady-state ADME (mass balance) of total molybdenum as a surrogate measure of ALXN1840 disposition in participants with WD. To confirm that steady state is adequately characterized by the plasma PK, a molybdenum mass balance assessment will be performed on Day 25 through Day 28 for the 15 mg/day dose and Day 36 through Day 39 for the 30 mg/day dose: if steady state is achieved, molybdenum(out) will equal molybdenum(in).</p>"
2.2.,,Background,"<p>ALXN1840 has been selected for development in WD d<span class=""s6"">u</span>e to its impro<span class=""s14"">v</span>ed stability properties over ammonium tetrathiomolybdate, which has previ<span class=""s6"">o</span>usly been studied in participants with WD and other indications. Ammonium tetrathiomolybdate and bis-choline tetrathiomolybdate nonclinical and clinical data reported to date support the efficacy and safety of ALXN1840.</p>
<p>ALXN1840 rapidly forms stable tetrathiomolybdate-copper-albumin TPCs, which stabilize free copper leading to a reduction in the NCC concentrations after correction for free copper bound to TPC (NCCc<span class=""s11"">o</span><span class=""s12"">rr</span>ec<span class=""s13"">t</span>e<span class=""s11"">d</span> ).</p>
<p>Studies in both healthy and WD animal models showed that treatment with tetrathiomolybdate results in removal of copper from the liver. Tetrathiomolybdate administered to healthy mice by intraperitoneal injection resulted in a dose-dependent reduction in liver copper concentration over a treatment range of 0 - 6 mg/kg/day (human equivalent dose [HED] by body surface area [BSA] scaling: 0 - 1 mg/kg/day). The results of these studies indicated that only 30% ‑ 40% of copper remained after 5 weeks of treatment. Similar liver decoppering (approximately 40% - 60%) was also reported in toxic milk mice (a WD animal model) at 5 mg/kg/ day for 14 days (HED by BSA scaling: 0.4 mg/kg/day; Mills, 1981; Czachor, 2002). In LEC WD model rats, 25 mg/kg/day of ALXN1840 (HED by BSA scaling: 4 mg/kg/day) administered by oral gavage for 10 days, resulted in an approximately 50% decrease in liver copper concentration. Because ALXN1840 has been shown to have a similar mechanism of action in healthy and WD animal models, a mechanism of action study in healthy participants is being performed (Study ALXN1840-HV-108) to demonstrate that ALXN1840 can result in a change from baseline in copper balance with repeat-dose ALXN1840 (30 mg/day) treatment.</p>
<p>In the Phase 2 proof-of-concept Study WTX101-201 in participants with WD, ALXN1840 demonstrated a sustained control of free copper as measured by NCCc<span class=""s11"">o</span><span class=""s12"">rr</span>ec<span class=""s13"">t</span>e<span class=""s11"">d</span> . Importantly, ALXN1840 treatment resulted in improvements in disability and neurologic symptoms as measured by the Unified Wilson Disease Rating Scale (UWDRS, Parts II and III) and stabilization of liver function (Weiss, 2017). Treatment with ALXN1840 resulted in an acceptable safety and tolerability profile when initiated at 15 mg daily with Investigator-driven, individual participant titration of dose based on safety, NCCc<span class=""s11"">o</span><span class=""s12"">rr</span>ec<span class=""s13"">t</span>e<span class=""s11"">d</span> , and symptoms.</p>
<p>Following single-dose administration of 60 mg ALXN1840, total molybdenum peaked at approximately 4.54 hours with a terminal elimination half-life measured at approximately 51 hours. In Study WTX101-201, the PK of ALXN1840, based on total molybdenum, indicated that exposure in participants with WD at a dose of 30 mg appeared consistent with previous results from healthy participants. The half-life was estimated to be approximately 24 hours at steady state on Days 84 and 168 and was shorter than estimated in previous studies. Based on a total molybdenum PK half-life of approximately 24 - 51 hours, total molybdenum steady state may conservatively be reached within approximately 10 - 12 days. Nevertheless, results (as</p>
<p> </p>
<p>measured by total molybdenum) obtained from the ALXN1840 balance study in the LEC WD rat model suggested that approximately 30% of a single dose of ALXN1840 remained in the liver by Day 7, indicating the possibility of tissue accumulation, particularly in the setting of high liver copper concentration (Plitz, 2019).</p>
<p>If the half-life of ALXN1840 in liver were longer than that of the systemic compartment, the accumulation may not be readily detected in the absence of a longer treatment period and with characterization of the terminal elimination period. An alternative approach to assessing steady state using total molybdenum PK is to assess whether the total molybdenum intake is equal to the total molybdenum output; this approach may detect any significant ongoing accumulation in the liver or other tissues.</p>

2.3.3.,,Overall Benefit-Risk Conclusion,"<p>Taking into account the measures implemented to minimize risk to participants in this study, the potential risks identified in association with ALXN1840 are justified by the anticipated benefits that may be afforded to participants with WD.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>This study will be conducted as an open-label, repeat-dose study to evaluate the effects of ALXN1840 on copper balance in participants with WD.</p>
<p>Treatment-experienced (which includes standard of care therapies or ALXN1840) and treatment-naïve participants are eligible for this study. Eligible patients will be classified into one of two cohorts:</p>
<p><span class=""s15"">•</span> Cohort 1 (treatment experienced): Patients who have received WD therapy for &gt; 28 days</p>
<p><span class=""s15"">•</span> Cohort 2 (treatment naïve): Patients who have received WD therapy for ≤ 28 days</p>
<p>Following screening and enrollment, participants will check-in to the CRU on Day -8 for the Run-in Period. The purpose of the Run-in Period is to support diet equilibration (Day -7 through Day -5) and measure pretreatment copper and molybdenum balance (Day -4 through Day -1). Participants will remain on a copper/molybdenum-controlled diet throughout both the Inpatient Period 1 (Day -8 to Day 9) and Inpatient Period 2 (Day 23 to Day 40). While not in the CRU, participants will be encouraged to adhere to their usual copper-controlled diet.</p>
<p>Participants who are taking copper-chelating therapies (penicillamine or trientine) at the time of enrollment will be discontinued from their decoppering therapies starting on Day -4 to allow a baseline assessment of copper/molybdenum balance prior to ALXN1840 treatment. On Day 1, participants will be initiated on 15 mg/day of ALXN1840 for a treatment period of approximately 28 days followed by titration up to 30 mg/day on Day 29. Before titration to 30 mg/day, the SRC will review available safety data through Day 23 for each participant.</p>
<p>Participants will have intake and output collection periods from Day -4 through Day -1, from Day 1 through Day 8, and Day 25 through Day 39. The collection periods will support an assessment of both copper and molybdenum balance (as a measure of ALXN1840 ADME) at the 15 mg and 30 mg doses and will allow assessment of the effects of duration of treatment on copper elimination and copper balance.</p>
<p>Collection periods for feces and urine will vary in duration from 3 to 15 days to support assessment of both copper and molybdenum balance before and at steady state for both 15 mg and 30 mg. Equilibration periods on copper/molybdenum-controlled diets will be a minimum of 48 hours. Copper balance will be calculated as the mean daily copper balance over each of the 4 collection periods. The interpretation of copper balance will be based on the criteria established by Hill,1986 when undertaking copper balance studies with zinc treatment. For assessment of ALXN1840 effect on copper balance, the time period for analysis will take into consideration the average bowel transit of approximately 40 hours (male: 33 hours; female: 47 hours) (Camilleri, 1986; Metcalf, 1987).</p>
<p>Throughout the inpatient periods, participants will remain on a copper-controlled diet. Meal portions will be weighed, and meal sizes will be appropriate to support male and female caloric consumption. Participants will be encouraged to complete 100% of all meals throughout the inpatient period to support quantification of copper and molybdenum intake. If participants are unable to complete the full meal, the uneaten portion will be weighed to allow calculation of meal fraction, and copper and molybdenum intake will be adjusted based on the fractional intake</p>
<p> </p>
<p>of the meal. In addition to food, fluid intake and type will be measured and recorded each day. Samples of all meals and fluids will be sent for bioanalysis to support accurate quantification of copper and molybdenum in fluids. In the event that items cannot be accurately quantified, items may be balanced during pretreatment period and post-treatment period to support the change from baseline assessment.</p>
<p>During the inpatient collection periods, daily urine will be pooled (24-hour collection) with volumes recorded for each 24-hour period; participants will be strongly encouraged to void within 2 hours of completion of each 24-hour period (ie, dosing time). Stool samples will be individually collected and each sample will include a collection date, time, and weight.</p>
<p>Participants may be discharged from the CRU on Day 9 and return on Day 22 or Day 23 (predose); all procedures will start on Day 23. To ensure flexibility, the Outpatient Period during Treatment Period 1 may be extended up to an additional 14 days with Investigator approval. In this situation, participants will be given additional investigational product to support daily dosing throughout the Outpatient Period. In such cases, the actual Outpatient Period duration will be recorded and the participant will continue Inpatient Period 2 at Day 23. During the Outpatient Period, participants will use SMS text messaging to confirm study intervention administration. At the CRU's discretion, participants may remain in the CRU during the outpatient period for safety or to maintain the integrity of the conduct of the study.</p>
<p>Blood sampling for PK/pharmacodynamic (PD) will occur over the 24-hour dosing period on Days 1, 25, 29, and 39. Predose PK samples will be collected at all time points during the intake and output collection period to help characterize PK during accumulation (Days 1 through 9 for 15 mg and Days 31 through 35 for 30 mg) and at steady state (Days 25 through 28 for 15 mg and Days 36 through 39 for 30 mg).</p>
<p>This study incorporates the use of an adaptive design. Adaptive features may be implemented at the discretion of the Investigator to support conduct of the study. Such adaptive features do not require amendment of the protocol. Adaptive features and their limits are described in Table 4.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Table 4. Adaptive Protocol Features</p>
<p>The study is designed as an open-label exploratory study to provide a descriptive assessment of copper balance in participants with WD, the target population for ALXN1840 therapy. The study is being conducted as a repeat-dose study to assess the effect of duration of ALXN1840 treatment and the effects of intra-patient dose increase on copper and molybdenum balance in participants with WD. The intra-patient dose escalation schedule is similar to that employed in the current Phase 3 Study WTX101-301. The similar schedule was chosen to characterize the decoppering effects expected early with treatment. This study is designed to supplement the mechanism of action study in healthy participants (Study ALXN1840-HV-108). While healthy participants are expected to be adequate to assess the mechanism of action of ALXN1840, characterization of copper balance in the WD population will help to understand if there are differences in the magnitude of effect between the 2 populations as this may be important to understand the doses that may support a net neutral versus a net negative copper balance. Limited nonclinical data on copper elimination with tetrathiomolybdate suggested copper excretion may be at least maintained or increased with repeated dosing (refer to the current IB).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Therefore, the duration of the study and multiple collection periods will better characterize the pattern of copper elimination over time. Such information may be helpful in understanding the decoppering and maintenance phases.</p>
<p>As the study involves intensive diet control and sampling, the study is planned to be conducted in a small number of participants with WD who will be admitted to a CRU for 2 inpatient periods. Inpatient Period 1 includes a baseline and initial 15 mg/day collection period during the accumulation phase followed by an Outpatient Period; Inpatient Period 2 with a second collection period to support analysis of copper balance at 15 mg/day steady state and a 30 mg/day accumulation and steady state.</p>
<p>During the Outpatient Period, participants will be encouraged to remain on a copper-controlled diet; however, to avoid confounding, a diet equilibration period is included in each study period. Overall, collection periods are a minimum of 3 days and as long as 15 days (which will be subdivided for analyses). Collection periods of at least 3 days were used to help minimize the impact of day-to-day variability on measurements. In addition, the time period for analysis will take into consideration the average bowel transit of approximately 40 hours (male: 33 hours; female: 47 hours) (Camilleri, 1986; Metcalf, 1987). Because the periods are of different lengths, the study will calculate mean daily copper balance.</p>
<p>While the primary endpoint for the study is an assessment of net copper balance, measurement of a pretreatment copper baseline will be helpful to understand the magnitude of effect of ALXN1840. To assess the copper baseline during the Inpatient Run-in Period, participants will be discontinued from their chelator therapy for approximately 4 days prior to initiating ALXN1840. During this period, participants will be maintained on a copper-controlled diet to minimize risk to the participants. In the Phase 3 study ALXN1840-WD-301, participants discontinue their chelator approximately 48 hours prior to initiation of ALXN1840 without reported complications. Among participants who discontinue chelator due to intolerance or noncompliance, the time from chelator discontinuation to the onset or worsening of symptoms varies from as little as 1 or 2 weeks to as long as months or years (Scheinberg, 1987). To prevent confounding of the study results, participants must be off zinc therapy for a minimum of 21 days prior to Day 1 because zinc works through upregulation of metallothionein (MT) in enterocytes resulting in elevation of fecal copper excretion. Previously, reports in the literature suggest that it can take up to 3 weeks or longer for zinc treatment to have an efficacious effect on copper balance (Brewer, 1983), so a delayed time to reversal of this effect could also occur. However, the physiologic turnover of human gastrointestinal epithelial cells is 3 - 5 days (Darwich, 2014); therefore, the inhibitory effect of zinc on intestinal copper absorption is expected to be minimal 21 days after discontinuation of zinc.</p>
<p>Following ALXN1840 administration, the active drug moiety tetrathiomolybdate rapidly binds copper to form TPC, mostly in the liver and blood, and presents as such in the systemic circulation. If TPC is not rapidly formed, tetrathiomolybdate spontaneously undergoes serial hydrolysis to form molybdate, the most common form of nutrient molybdenum, and is excreted in the urine. Total molybdenum concentration has been measured as a surrogate of ALXN1840 PK; however, total molybdenum concentration cannot distinguish whether the molybdenum is protein bound (mostly as TPC), free active drug as ALXN1840, intermediate hydrolysis products, or molybdate. To better characterize the amount of non-TPC-bound drug and its unbound degradation products, plasma PUF-molybdenum has also been measured, which</p>
<p> </p>
<p>represents the free parent drug (ALXN1840), short-lived intermediate hydrolysis products, and molybdate, which may have originated from the tetrathiomolybdate or from food intake as a micronutrient. Total molybdenum PK and free molybdenum PK serve as surrogate measures of ALXN1840 PK. To better characterize the ADME of ALXN1840, the PK of both total molybdenum and PUF-molybdenum will be characterized and described.</p>
<p>This study is designed to provide an extensive assessment of copper and molybdenum balance over the first 40 days of treatment with ALXN1840 and support a more robust understanding of the effects of duration of treatment and dose of ALXN1840 on copper balance. Half-life estimates for total molybdenum in Study WTX101-201 were reported to be approximately 24 hours at steady state on Days 84 and 168, while in healthy participants, total molybdenum half-life was measured closer to 51 hours. With a half-life within this range, the sample collection periods include assessment of copper and molybdenum balance both during accumulation and at steady state for both the 15 mg/day and 30 mg/day doses. The study will include both intake and output collection as well as PK and copper assessments (ie, ceruloplasmin-bound copper and labile bound copper [LBC]) to inform the relationship between balance measurements and copper and molybdenum levels in the blood.</p>
<p>Finally, preclinical data from ALXN1840 ADME study suggest the potential for molybdenum accumulation in the liver of participants with WD; therefore, an assessment of molybdenum balance will help determine whether steady state has been reached as defined by a molybdenum balance of neutral during the collection period. Because molybdenum is a necessary micronutrient and serves as a cofactor for a number of enzymes and may exist in intracellular stores, small variations in molybdenum balance could be due to molybdate rather than ALXN1840.</p>"
4.2.1.,,Participant Input into Design,"<p>Not applicable.</p>
<p>ALXN1840 at 60 mg single dose has been shown to have an adequate safety profile and be well-tolerated in healthy male and female participants in the Phase 1 bioavailability Studies WTX101-101 and WTX101-102. In addition, preliminary data from Study WTX101-106 have also shown ALXN1840 to be well tolerated in healthy Japanese and non-Japanese male and female participants at a single dose of 15 mg or 60 mg. While no repeat-dose studies have been performed in healthy participants, bis-choline tetrathiomolybdate (ALXN1840) has been tested in a range of oncologic indications with a maximum tolerated dose of 300 mg/day (Lowndes, 2008).</p>
<p>In the Phase 2 Study WTX101-201 conducted in participants with WD, the daily ALXN1840 doses were 15 mg for 6 (21%) participants, 30 mg for 13 (46%) participants, and 60 mg (32%) for 9 participants at Week 24 when the primary endpoint assessment was conducted, or at the last dose received for participants with early discontinuation. The 15 to 60 mg/day dose range has been demonstrated to be efficacious with a favorable safety profile in treating participants with WD (Weiss, 2017). Based on these Phase 2 study results, the ongoing Phase 3 Study WTX101-301 in participants with WD has been testing the efficacy and safety of ALXN1840 at</p>
<p> </p>
<p>a dose titration range from 15 mg to 60 mg daily with data to date supporting an acceptable safety profile.</p>
<p>Similar to the Phase 2 study, in Study WTX101-301, participants are started at a dose of 15 mg/day and, after review of all safety information, participants may be titrated up to 30 mg/day after approximately 4 weeks. Based on the results of Study WTX101-201, doses ranging from 15 mg/day to 60 mg/day were adequate to significantly decrease non-ceruloplasmin corrected copper concentrations corrected for TPC (NCCc<span class=""s11"">o</span><span class=""s12"">rr</span>ec<span class=""s13"">t</span>e<span class=""s11"">d</span> ) and, in many cases, return the NCC to normal concentrations of copper control. Given the robust improvement in copper control, it is hypothesized that doses within the 15 to 30 mg/day range will be adequate to drive a net negative copper balance. The current study will explore copper balance in response to treatment with ALXN1840, with the purpose of informing the dose and dosing duration required to result in adequate copper elimination to drive a measurable net negative copper balance. Copper balance will be assessed for the 15 mg/day dose at the beginning and end of the 15 mg/day treatment period, and at the beginning of the 30 mg/day treatment period. Copper balance will be assessed for the 30 mg/day dose at Days 31 through 35 and Days 36 through 39. The multiple collection periods will support assessment of duration of treatment and dose on copper elimination and overall copper balance.</p>
<p>In this study, dosing for ALXN1840 will be initiated at 15 mg once daily for a minimum of 4 weeks, with an increase to 30 mg after 4 weeks, unless there are safety concerns that, in the opinion of the Investigator(s) and/or Alexion, may place participants at undue risk, in which case, participants may remain on the 15 mg/day dose for the duration of the study. Further dose adjustments will be made as appropriate.</p>
<p>The dose should be decreased or interrupted if any of the relevant Dose Modification Criteria are met. Deviation from the dose modification guidelines must be agreed with the Alexion Medical Monitor.</p>

<p>As ALXN1840 is expected to increase copper excretion through fecal excretion, copper in stool will be critical for determining copper balance. Because stools can be irregular, assessment of copper and molybdenum balance will only include data up to the day of the final bowel movement. For example, for the period Day 1 through Day 8, if the final bowel movement occurs on Day 7, average daily copper balance for the Day 1 through Day 8 period will only include data from Day 1 through Day 7.</p>

A participant will be considered lost to follow-up if he or she repeatedly fails to return for scheduled visits and is unable to be contacted by the study site.</p>
<p>The following actions must be taken if a participant fails to return to the clinic for a required study visit:</p>
<p><span class=""s15"">•</span> The site must attempt to contact the participant and reschedule the missed visit as 
soon as possible and counsel the participant on the importance of maintaining the 
assigned visit schedule and ascertain whether or not the participant wishes to and/or 
should continue in the study.</p>
<p><span class=""s15"">•</span> Before a participant is deemed lost to follow-up, the Investigator or designee must 
make every effort to regain contact with the participant (where possible, 3 telephone 
calls and, if necessary, a certified letter to the participant's last known mailing 
address or local equivalent methods). These contact attempts should be documented 
in the participant's medical record.</p>
<p><span class=""s15"">•</span> Should the participant continue to be unreachable, he/she will be considered to have 
withdrawn from the study.</p>
<p>Discontinuation of specific sites or of the study as a whole are handled as part of Section 10.1.8.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span class=""s15"">•</span> Study procedures and their timing are summarized in the SoA (Section 1.3). Protocol 
waivers or exemptions are not allowed.</p>
<p><span class=""s15"">•</span> Immediate safety concerns should be discussed with Alexion immediately upon 
occurrence or awareness to determine if the participant should continue or 
discontinue study intervention.</p>
<p><span class=""s15"">•</span> Adherence to the study design requirements, including those specified in the SoA, is 
essential and required for study conduct.</p>
<p><span class=""s15"">•</span> All screening evaluations must be completed and reviewed to confirm that potential 
participants meet all eligibility criteria. The Investigator will maintain a screening log 
to record details of all participants screened and to confirm eligibility or record 
reasons for screening failure, as applicable.</p>
<p><span class=""s15"">•</span> The following only applies to sites in the US.</p>
<p><span class=""s15"">−</span> In the US only, it is permissible for study visits for individual participants to occur at more than 1 site. Some sites may perform screening procedures only and not any of the remaining study procedures. These sites will be known as “screening sites”. The procedures performed at screening sites are defined in the Screening column (Study Days -42 to -9 and -21) of the SoA (Section 1.3). Following the completion of screening procedures at a screening site, eligible participants will be transferred to the CRU, where the remaining study procedures and visits will occur. Site-to-site transfer of the participant will be documented accordingly.</p>"
8.1.1.,,,"<p>Copper and Molybdenum Bal<span class=""s6"">a</span>nce Measurements</p>
<p>Copper and molybdenum balance measurements will be made on all intake (ie, investigational agent, food and fluids) and all output (urine and feces) from participants as indicated in the SoA. The copper and molybdenum concentration of each sample will be determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Copper and molybdenum content of all intake and output will be calculated based on the volume or weight of intake and output and the concentration of representative samples.</p>"
8.1.1.1.,,Food and Fluid Collection for Copper and Molybdenum Concentrations,"<p>Samples of all meal and fluid batches will be collected and analyzed for measurement of copper and molybdenum content. A minimum of 3 complete portions/meals from each food and liquid batch will be sent for analysis. All participants will drink water from the same large water bottle dispenser. Samples of water from this dispenser will be collected and analyzed for copper and molybdenum content.</p>
<p>Samples will be collected, stored and shipped as detailed in the Laboratory Manual. All sample handling procedures will be documented in detail in the Laboratory Manual. Copper and</p>
<p> </p>
<p>molybdenum concentration of each food sample (ng/g) and each fluid sample (ng/mL) sample will be determined by ICP-MS.</p>"
8.1.1.2.,,Urine Collection for Measurement of Copper and Molybdenum content,"<p>Urine samples to measure copper and molybdenum content will be collected periodically as described in the SoA (Table 1). Samples will be collected, stored and shipped as detailed in the Laboratory Manual. For each 24-hour collection period, urine will be pooled for analysis and volumes will be recorded. All sample handling procedures will be documented in detail as described in the Laboratory Manual. Copper and molybdenum concentration (ng/mL) of each 24-hour urine sample will be determined by ICP-MS.</p>"
8.1.1.3.,,Fecal Collection for Measurement of Copper and Molybdenum Content,"<p>Fecal samples to measure copper and molybdenum content will be collected periodically as described in the SoA (Table 1). Samples will be collected, stored, and shipped as detailed in the Laboratory Manual. Fecal samples will be individually collected, weighed, and stored. The weight and time of each bowel movement will be recorded. All sample handling procedures will be documented in detail in the Laboratory Manual. Copper and molybdenum concentration (ng/g) of each stool sample will be determined by ICP-MS; each sample will be analyzed using a minimum of technical triplicates.</p>
<p>Planned time points for all safety assessments are provided in the SoA (Section 1.3).</p>
<p>When multiple procedures are scheduled to occur at the same time, the following order of events should be strictly adhered to whenever possible: ECG, vital signs, blood sampling, study intervention administration, and meal.</p>
<p>Pharmacokinetic collection should occur as close as possible to the scheduled time.</p>
<p>All routine safety laboratory samples should be drawn following a minimum of 8 hours fasting.</p>"
8.2.1.,,Physical Examinations,"<p><span class=""s15"">•</span> A complete physical examination will include, at a minimum, assessments of the 
cardiovascular, respiratory, gastrointestinal, and neurological systems. Height (at 
Screening only) and weight (as per the SoA for physical examinations) will also be 
measured and recorded. A symptom-driven physical examination may be performed at 
other times, at the Principal Investigator's discretion. 
8.2.2. Vital Signs</p>
<p><span class=""s15"">•</span> Bo<span class=""s14"">d</span>y temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, and systolic and diastolic blood pressure 
(mm Hg) will be assessed using consistent methods and equipment to allow 
comparability and reproducibility throughout the study.</p>
<p><span class=""s15"">•</span> Blood pressure and heart rate measurements will be assessed with a completely 
automated device. Manual techniques will be used only if an automated device is not 
available.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span class=""s15"">•</span> Blood pressure and heart rate measurements should be preceded by at least 5 minutes of 
rest for the participant in a quiet setting without distractions (eg, television, cell phones). 
Ideally, the same arm for each participant should be used for measurements.</p>
<p><span class=""s15"">•</span> Vital signs will be measured in a supine position after 5 minutes rest and will include 
temperature, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and heart rate. Vital signs will consist 
of a single pulse and blood pressure measurement. If vital signs are abnormal as defined 
by inclusion/ exclusion criteria, 2 additional vital signs measurements will be made. The 
average of the 3 vital signs measurements will be recorded in the CRF and used to 
determine participant eligibility. The average of the blood pressure readings will be 
recorded in the CRF. 
8.2.3. Electrocardiograms</p>
<p><span class=""s15"">•</span> Triplicate 12-lead ECGs will be conducted as outlined in the SoA (see Section 1.3) to 
obtain heart rate, PR, QRS, QT, and QTc intervals. Refer to Section 7 for QTc 
withdrawal criteria and any additional QTc readings that may be necessary. As with vital 
signs, if ECG interval measurements are abnormal, an additional triplicate will be 
performed and recorded in the CRF. 
8.2.4. Clinical Safety Laboratory Assessments</p>
<p><span class=""s15"">•</span> See Section 10.2 for the list of clinical laboratory tests to be performed and to the SoA 
(Section 1.3) for the timing and frequency.</p>
<p><span class=""s15"">•</span> The Investigator must review the laboratory report, document this review, and record any 
clinically relevant changes occurring during the study in the AE section of the CRF. The 
laboratory reports must be filed with the source documents. Clinically significant 
laboratory values are those deemed by the Investigator to be clinically significant 
resulting in further evaluation or treatment or those associated with an AE or clinical 
signs or symptoms.</p>
<p><span class=""s15"">•</span> All laboratory tests with values considered abnormal and clinically significant during 
participation in the study or after the last dose of study intervention should be repeated 
until the values return to normal or baseline or are no longer considered clinically 
significant by the Investigator or Medical Monitor.</p>
<p class=""p9"">−</p>
<p class=""p9"">−</p>
<p>If such values do not return to normal/baseline within a period of time judged reasonable by the Investigator, the etiology should be identified, and Alexion notified.</p>
<p>All protocol-required laboratory assessments, as defined in Section 10.2, must be conducted in accordance with the laboratory manual and the SoA.</p>
<p>All laboratory values from non-protocol-specified laboratory assessments must also be recorded in the CRF.</p>
<p> </p>"
8.2.4.1.,,Bowel and Urine Monitoring,"<p>Participant's bowel movements and urination will be monitored by the clinical staff. The clinical staff will record in the CRF each time a fecal and urine sample is collected. All urine and feces must be collected from Day -4 through Day -1, Day 1 through Day 8, Day 25 through Day 39.</p>"
8.2.4.2.,,Intake Monitoring,"<p>To support accurate quantification of copper/molybdenum intake, each participant's intake including both food and fluids will be monitored and recorded. Following each standardized meal, the clinical staff will record 100% completion of each meal including all liquids. If a participant is unable to eat 100% of the food for a given meal, the remaining food will be weighed and reported in the CRF to support accurate determination of copper/molybdenum as a fraction of the total meal. Similarly, if participants do not complete 100% of non-water fluids with meal, the remaining volume will be measured and recorded in the CRF. In the case of water intake, the staff will record daily water volume intake in the CRF.</p>"
8.2.5.,,Suicidal Ideation and Behavior Risk Monitoring,"<p>Suicidal ideation and behavioral changes will be recorded as adverse events and may, at the discretion of the Investigator, result in withdrawal of the participation from the study and urgent referral for psychiatric treatment.</p>"
8.2.6.,,Pregnancy,"<p><span class=""s15"">•</span> Pregnancy data from female participants and female spouses/partners of male participants 
will be collected from the signing of the ICF and at the time points specified in the SoA. 
Any female participant who becomes pregnant while participating in the study will be 
discontinued from the study intervention. If a pregnancy is reported, the Investigator must 
immediately inform Alexion within 24 hours of awareness of the pregnancy and follow 
the procedures outlined in Section 10.4.</p>
<p><span class=""s15"">•</span> For all Alexion products, both in development or post approval, exposure during 
pregnancy must be recorded and the pregnancy followed, until the outcome of the 
pregnancy is known (ie, spontaneous miscarriage, elective termination, normal birth, or 
congenital abnormality), even if the participant discontinues the study intervention or 
withdraws from the study. The corresponding infant must be followed for 3 months 
postpartum.</p>
<p><span class=""s15"">•</span> Pregnancy is not considered as an AE (Section 10.4) unless there is a suspicion that the 
study intervention may have interfered with the effectiveness of a contraceptive 
medication. However, complications of pregnancy and abnormal outcomes of pregnancy 
are AEs and may meet the criteria for an SAE (eg, ectopic pregnancy, spontaneous 
abortion, intrauterine fetal demise, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly) (Section 8.3). 
Elective abortions without complications should not be reported as AEs.</p>
<p>The definitions of AEs and SAEs can be found in Section 10.3.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>All AEs will be reported to the Investigator or qualified designee by the participant (or, when appropriate, by a caregiver, surrogate, or the participant's legally authorized representative).</p>
<p>The Investigator and any qualified designees are responsible for detecting, documenting, and recording events that meet the definition of an AE or SAE and remain responsible for following up AEs that are serious, considered related to the study intervention or study procedures, or that caused the participant to discontinue the study intervention (see Section 7).</p>
<p>Procedures for recording, evaluating, follow-up, and reporting AEs and SAEs are outlined in Section 10.3.</p>"
8.3.1.,,Time Period and Frequency for Collecting AE and SAE Information,"<p>All AEs and SAEs will be collected from the signing of the ICF until the EOS Visit.</p>
<p>All SAEs will be recorded and reported to Alexion or the designee immediately and under no circumstance should this exceed 24 hours, as indicated in Section 10.3. The Investigator will submit any updated SAE data to Alexion within 24 hours of it being available.</p>
<p>Investigators are not obligated to actively seek AE or SAE data after conclusion of the study participation. However, if the Investigator learns of any SAE, including a death, at any time after a participant has been discharged from the study, and he/she considers the event to be reasonably related to the study intervention or study participation, the Investigator must promptly notify Alexion.</p>"
8.3.2.,,Method of Detecting AEs and SAEs,"<p>The method of recording, evaluating, and assessing causality of AE and SAE and the procedures for completing and transmitting SAE reports are provided in Section 10.3.</p>
<p>Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting AEs and/or SAEs. Open-ended and non-leading verbal questioning of the participant is the preferred method to inquire about AE occurrences.</p>"
8.3.3.,,Follow-up of AEs and SAEs,"<p>After the initial AE/SAE report, the Investigator is required to proactively follow up on each participant at subsequent visits/contacts. All SAEs will be followed up until resolution, stabilization, the event is otherwise explained, or the participant is lost to follow-up (as defined in Section 7.3). Further information on follow-up procedures is provided in Section 10.3.</p>"
8.3.4.,,Regulatory Reporting Requirements for SAEs,"<p><span class=""s15"">•</span> Prompt notification of an SAE by the Investigator to Alexion is essential so that legal 
obligations and ethical responsibilities toward the safety of participants and the safety 
of a study intervention under clinical investigation are met.</p>
<p><span class=""s15"">•</span> Alexion has a legal responsibility to notify both the local regulatory authority and 
other regulatory agencies about the safety of a study intervention under clinical 
investigation. Alexion will comply with country-specific regulatory requirements 
relating to safety reporting to the regulatory authority, Institutional Review Boards 
(IRBs)/ Independent Ethics Committees (IECs), and Investigators.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span class=""s15"">•</span> Suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSARs) must be reported 
according to local regulatory requirements and Alexion policy and forwarded to 
Investigators as necessary.</p>
<p><span class=""s15"">•</span> An Investigator who receives an Investigator safety report describing an SAE or other 
specific safety information (eg, summary or listing of SAEs) from Alexion will 
review and then file it along with the IB and will notify the IRB/IEC, if appropriate 
according to local requirements. 
8.3.5. Adverse Events of Special Interest 
There are no adverse events of special interest for this study. 
8.3.6. Retained and Biobanked Sample 
A single biobanked serum sample will be collected predose from each participant to serve as a retained sample during the study. Samples will remain on site and will be discarded following the completion of the clinical study report. The sample will not be used for genetic testing (see Section 8.7).

<p>The population sets used for analysis are defined Table 8.</p>
<p>Table 8:</p>
<p>Populations for Analysis</p>
<p>Statistical methods described in this section will be further elaborated in a separate Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP). Summary statistics will be computed and displayed by visit where applicable and will be presented by cohort (treatment experienced/treatment naïve), and overall Descriptive statistics for continuous variables will minimally include the number of participants, mean, standard deviation, minimum, median, and maximum. For categorical variables, frequencies, and percentages will be presented. Graphical displays will be provided as appropriate.</p>
<p>Analyses will be performed using the SAS® software Version 9.4 or higher.</p>"
9.4.1.,,Primary Analysis,"<p>The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate a net negative copper balance with daily repeat-dose ALXN1840 treatment (15 mg and 30 mg) in participants with WD.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The primary analysis will be performed using the Full Analysis Set. Average daily copper balance and molybdenum balance will be calculated over the following periods:</p>"
9.4.2.,,Secondary Analyses,"<p>Secondary analyses will be performed using the Full Analysis Set. The secondary continuous endpoints (including copper balance, molybdenum balance, and 24-hour urine excretion of copper and molybdenum) will be analyzed using the same methods described for the primary analysis.</p>"
9.4.3.,,Safety Analysis,"<p>Safety analyses will be performed using the Safety Analysis Set.</p>
<p>Safety analyses will include all AEs, ECGs, clinical laboratory data, physical examinations, and vital sign measurements using descriptive statistics.</p>
<p>No inferential statistical analyses are planned for the safety parameters of this study. The incidence of AEs and SAEs will be summarized by System Organ Class and Preferred Term for each treatment and overall, and by relationship to study intervention. Adverse events will also be summarized by treatment and overall by severity. Serious AEs and AEs resulting in withdrawal from the study will be listed. Participants having multiple AEs within a category (eg, overall, System Organ Class, Preferred Term) will be counted once in that category. For severity tables, a participant's most severe event within a category will be counted.</p>
<p>Changes from baseline in vital sign measurements and laboratory assessments (eg, chemistry, hematology, coagulation, and urinalysis) will be summarized by treatment. Laboratory parameter values will be graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology <span class=""s6"">C</span>riteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE). Shift tables by treatment will be produced for these laboratory</p>
<p> </p>
<p>parameters. These tables will summarize the number of participants with each baseline grade relative to the reference ranges and changes to the worst highest grade assessed post dose during the study.</p>
<p>Electrocardiogram parameters will be measured at the specified time points as per the SoA (Table 1), including heart rate, PR, RR, QRS, QT, and QTcF intervals. The average of the triplicate ECG readings at the time points collected will be calculated, and changes from pretreatment baseline values will be assessed by each treatment.</p>
<p>All concomitant medications will be coded and summarized using the World Health Organization (WHO) Drug Dictionary.</p>"
9.4.4.,,"Pharmacokinetic, Pharmacodynamic, and Biomarker Analyses","<p>For PK, PD, and biomarker endpoints, analyses will be performed using the PK/PD Analysis Set.

10.4.2.,,Collection of Pregnancy Information,"<p>If a female participant or a male participant's female spouse/partner becomes pregnant after the first dose of ALXN1840 through 3 months after the end of systemic exposure of the study intervention, the Investigator must submit the “Pregnancy/Breastfeeding Reporting and Outcome Form” to Alexion Global Drug Safety (GDS) via fax or email (see Section 10.3 for contact information). When the outcome of the pregnancy becomes known, the form should be updated and submitted to Alexion GDS. If additional follow-up is required, the Investigator will be requested to provide the information.</p>
<p>Exposure of an infant to an Alexion product during breastfeeding must also be reported (via the “Pregnancy/Breastfeeding Reporting and Outcome Form”) and any AEs experienced by the infant must be reported to Alexion GDS or designee via email or facsimile (see Section 10.3 for contact information).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>To date, following a review of the limited available COVID-19 vaccine data (eg, Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna, AstraZeneca), it is unlikely that the immune response to a COVID-19 vaccine will be diminished with concomitant ALXN1840 administration, based on ALXN1840's mechanism of action. There is currently no information available evaluating the safety or efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines in participants treated with ALXN1840.</p>
<p>Local and national guidelines should be consulted for recommendations related to COVID-19 vaccination. Alexion suggests that participants complete vaccination series before study participation, if feasible. The decision to allow COVID-19 vaccinated participants to continue in the study should be made by the investigator on a participant-by-participant basis.</p>
<p>The potential risks identified and mitigation measures put in place in light of the COVID-19 vaccination rollout are provided in Table 10.</p>
