    <p>PROTOCOL AMENDMENT SUMMARY OF CHANGES TABLE</p>\n<p><b>Amendment 3.1 (US),\
    \ 18 Mar 2022</b></p>\n<p>This amendment is considered to be substantial based\

    \ Parliament and the Council of the European Union, the US Food and Drug Administration's\
    \ (FDA) regulation at 21 CFR part 312.30(b), and any applicable local regulations.</p>\n\
    <p><b>Overall Rationale for the Amendment</b></p>\n<p>The main reason for preparation\
    \ of this amendment was to clarify study procedures occurring across different\
    \ sites in the US, so as to facilitate participant recruitment across different\

    \ A Phase 2, Open-label Study to Assess Copper and Molybdenum Balance in Participants\
    \ with Wilson Disease Treated with ALXN1840 <b>Short Title:</b> Copper and Molybdenum\
    \ Balance in Participants with Wilson Disease Treated with ALXN1840</p>\n<p><b>Rationale:</b></p>\n\
    <p>The principal aim of this exploratory study is to investigate the effects of\
    \ ALXN1840 on copper balance in participants with Wilson disease (WD). The study\
    \ will specifically evaluate the effects of 2 different ALXN1840 doses as well\
    \ as the duration of treatment on copper balance to further elucidate the dose\
    \ response of \u201Cdecoppering\u201D versus \u201Cmaintenance\u201D dose in participants\
    \ with WD.</p>\n<p>The secondary aim of the study is to characterize the steady-state\
    \ absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME; mass balance) of\
    \ total molybdenum which is a surrogate measure of ALXN1840 disposition in participants\
    \ with WD.</p>\n<p>ALXN1840 contains the active anion tetrathiomolybdate and has\
    \ been shown to cause negative copper balance when administered to healthy animals\
    \ as well as decopper the liver in animal models of WD. In Study WTX101-201, which\
    \ assessed the safety and efficacy of ALXN1840 in participants with WD, ALXN1840\
    \ demonstrated enhanced copper control as measured by reduced plasma non-ceruloplasmin-bound\
    \ copper (NCC) corrected (NCCc<span class=\"s11\">o</span><span class=\"s12\"\
    >rr</span>ec<span class=\"s13\">t</span>e<span class=\"s11\">d</span> ) for the\
    \ stable tetrathiomolybdate- copper -albumin tripartite complex (TPC).</p>\n<p>Depletion\
    \ of copper by ALXN1840 has been shown to occur primarily through fecal elimination\
    \ in both healthy and WD animal models. In this study, copper balance will be\
    \ calculated as the difference between measured copper input in food and drink\
    \ and measured copper output in urine and feces. This method is classically considered\
    \ the most objective measure of decoppering ability with a decoppering agent able\
    \ to drive a net negative copper balance.</p>\n<p>As part of the secondary objective,\
    \ to confirm that ALXN1840 steady state is adequately characterized by the plasma\
    \ pharmacokinetics (PK), a molybdenum mass balance assessment will be performed\
    \ at predicted steady state for the 15 mg/day and 30 mg/day doses: if steady state\
    \ is achieved, molybdenum(out) will equal molybdenum(in). This approach may also\
    \ detect potential accumulation in the liver or other tissues of participants\
    \ with WD.</p>\n<p>Page 9 of 74 \nAlexion Confidential</p>\n<p class=\"p4\"> </p>\n\

    \ death, if it was more severe.</p>\n<p><b>3. Requires inpatient hospitalization\
    \ or prolongation of existing hospitalization</b></p>\n<p>In general, hospitalization\
    \ signifies that the participant has been detained (usually involving at least\
    \ an overnight stay) at the hospital or emergency ward for observation and/or\
    \ treatment that would not have been appropriate in the physician's office or\
    \ outpatient setting. Complications that occur during hospitalization are AEs.\
    \ If a complication prolongs hospitalization or fulfills any other serious criteria,\
    \ the event is serious. When in doubt as to whether \u201Chospitalization\u201D\
    \ occurred or was necessary, the AE should be considered serious.</p>\n<p>Hospitalization\
    \ for elective treatment of a pre-existing condition that did not worsen from\
    \ baseline is not considered an AE.</p>\n<p><b>4. Results in persistent disability/incapacity</b></p>\n\
    <p>\u2022 The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person's ability\
    \ to conduct normal life functions.</p>\n<p>\u2022 This definition is not intended\
    \ to include experiences of relatively minor medical significance such as \nuncomplicated\
    \ headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma (eg,\
    \ sprained ankle) \nwhich may interfere with or prevent everyday life functions\
    \ but do not constitute a substantial disruption.</p>\n<p><b>5. Is a congenital\
    \ anomaly/birth defect</b></p>\n<p><b>6. Other situations:</b></p>\n<p>\u2022\
    \ Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether SAE reporting\
    \ is appropriate in other \nsituations such as important medical events that may\
    \ not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or \nhospitalization\
    \ but may jeopardize the participant or may require medical or surgical intervention\
    \ to prevent \none of the other outcomes listed in the above definition. These\
    \ events should usually be considered serious.</p>\n<p>\u2022 Examples of such\
    \ events include invasive or malignant cancers, intensive treatment in an emergency\
    \ room or \nat <span class=\"s14\">h</span>ome for allergic bronchospasm, blood\
    \ dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization, or \ndevelopment\
    \ of drug dependency or drug abuse.</p>\n<p><b>A suspected unexpected serious\
    \ adverse reaction (SUSAR) is defined as:</b></p>\n<p>A serious event that is\
    \ not listed in the Reference Safety Information of the Investigator's Brochure\
    \ and that the Investigator or Sponsor identifies as related to investigational\
    \ product or procedure. United States Title 21 CFR 312.32 and European Union Clinical\
    \ Trial Directive 2001/20/EC and the associated detailed guidances or national\
    \ regulatory requirements in participating countries require the reporting of\
    \ SUSARs. Alexion has procedures that will be followed for the recording and expedited\
    \ reporting of SUSARs that are consistent with global regulations and the associated\
    \ detailed guidances. Suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions will be reported\

    <p>ALXN1840 (bis-choline tetrathiomolybdate; formerly known as WTX101) is a novel
    copper binding agent in development for the treatment of WD.</p>'

  sectionTitle: Study Rationale
  text: "<p>The principal aim of this exploratory study is to investigate the effects\
    \ of ALXN1840 on copper balance in participants with WD. The study will specifically\
    \ evaluate the effects of 2 different ALXN1840 dose levels as well as the duration\
    \ of treatment on copper balance to further elucidate the dose response of \u201C\
    decoppering\u201D versus \u201Cmaintenance\u201D dose in participants with WD.</p>\n\
    <p>ALXN1840 contains the active anion tetrathiomolybdate and has been shown to\
    \ cause negative copper balance when administered to healthy animals as well as\
    \ decopper the liver in animal models of WD (Mills, 1981; Czachor, 2002). In Study\
    \ WTX101-201, which assessed the safety and efficacy of ALXN1840 in participants\
    \ with WD, ALXN1840 demonstrated enhanced copper control as measured by reduced\
    \ plasma NCCc<span class=\"s11\">o</span><span class=\"s12\">rr</span>ec<span\
    \ class=\"s13\">t</span>e<span class=\"s11\">d</span> for the stable tetrathiomolybdatecopper-albumin\
    \ TPC (Weiss, 2017).</p>\n<p>Depletion of copper by ALXN1840 has been shown to\
    \ occur primarily through fecal elimination in both healthy and WD animal models.\
    \ Sheep injected with 30 mg/day of tetrathiomolybdate for 5 days were shown to\
    \ have an elevation of fecal copper during the treatment period increasing from\
    \ a baseline of approximately 3 mg/day up to approximately 7 mg/day during the\
    \ treatment period, before returning to baseline concentrations (Mason, 1988).\
    \ Similarly, when Long-Evans Cinnamon (LEC) WD model rats were injected intraperitoneally\
    \ with a saline solution of tetrathiomolybdate at a dose of 10 mg/kg body weight\
    \ for 8 consecutive days, the amounts of both copper and molybdenum excreted into\
    \ the feces increased significantly (Ogra, 2000), which may suggest that copper\
    \ is excreted in a complex with tetrathiomolybdate into the feces. While fecal\
    \ copper increases with tetrathiomolybdate, the amount of copper excreted into\
    \ the urine decreased and that of molybdenum increased significantly during treatment\
    \ with tetrathiomolybdate. Molybdenum in the urine was molybdate which does not\
    \ bind copper (data on file). These findings are in line with other studies showing\
    \ enhanced biliary and/or fecal excretion of copper and molybdenum upon administration\
    \ of tetrathiomolybdate in rats and sheep (Komatsu, 2000; Ogra, 1995; Mason, 1988).</p>\n\
    <p>We hypothesize that repeated doses of ALXN1840 may drive a net negative copper\
    \ balance in participants with WD by increasing fecal excretion of copper. In\
    \ this study, copper balance will be calculated as the difference between measured\
    \ copper input in food and drink and measured copper output in urine and feces.\
    \ This method is classically considered the most objective measure of decoppering\
    \ ability with a decoppering agent able to drive a net negative copper balance\
    \ (Hill,1986; Strickland, 1971; Walshe, 1973). The purpose of this study is to\
    \ provide additional descriptive characterization of the effect of ALXN1840 on\
    \ copper balance in participants with WD. Further data obtained may help support\
    \ characterization of a \u201Cdecoppering\u201D versus \u201Cmaintenance\u201D\
    \ dose of ALXN1840, where a decoppering dose would be a dose sufficient to drive\
    \ a net negative copper balance and maintenance would support a more neutral copper\
    \ balance.</p>\n<p>Page 18 of 74 \nAlexion Confidential</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">\

    s6\">0</span>-WD-204</p>\n<p>The secondary aim of the study is to characterize\
    \ the steady-state ADME (mass balance) of total molybdenum as a surrogate measure\
    \ of ALXN1840 disposition in participants with WD. To confirm that steady state\
    \ is adequately characterized by the plasma PK, a molybdenum mass balance assessment\
    \ will be performed on Day 25 through Day 28 for the 15 mg/day dose and Day 36\
    \ through Day 39 for the 30 mg/day dose: if steady state is achieved, molybdenum(out)\
    \ will equal molybdenum(in).</p>\n<p><b>2.2. Background</b></p>\n<p>ALXN1840 has\
    \ been selected for development in WD d<span class=\"s6\">u</span>e to its impro<span\

    \ which has previ<span class=\"s6\">o</span>usly been studied in participants\
    \ with WD and other indications. Ammonium tetrathiomolybdate and bis-choline tetrathiomolybdate\
    \ nonclinical and clinical data reported to date support the efficacy and safety\
    \ of ALXN1840.</p>\n<p>ALXN1840 rapidly forms stable tetrathiomolybdate-copper-albumin\
    \ TPCs, which stabilize free copper leading to a reduction in the NCC concentrations\
    \ after correction for free copper bound to TPC (NCCc<span class=\"s11\">o</span><span\
    \ class=\"s12\">rr</span>ec<span class=\"s13\">t</span>e<span class=\"s11\">d</span>\
    \ ).</p>\n<p>Studies in both healthy and WD animal models showed that treatment\
    \ with tetrathiomolybdate results in removal of copper from the liver. Tetrathiomolybdate\
    \ administered to healthy mice by intraperitoneal injection resulted in a dose-dependent\
    \ reduction in liver copper concentration over a treatment range of 0 - 6 mg/kg/day\
    \ (human equivalent dose [HED] by body surface area [BSA] scaling: 0 - 1 mg/kg/day).\
    \ The results of these studies indicated that only 30% \u2011 40% of copper remained\
    \ after 5 weeks of treatment. Similar liver decoppering (approximately 40% - 60%)\
    \ was also reported in toxic milk mice (a WD animal model) at 5 mg/kg/ day for\
    \ 14 days (HED by BSA scaling: 0.4 mg/kg/day; Mills, 1981; Czachor, 2002). In\
    \ LEC WD model rats, 25 mg/kg/day of ALXN1840 (HED by BSA scaling: 4 mg/kg/day)\
    \ administered by oral gavage for 10 days, resulted in an approximately 50% decrease\
    \ in liver copper concentration. Because ALXN1840 has been shown to have a similar\
    \ mechanism of action in healthy and WD animal models, a mechanism of action study\
    \ in healthy participants is being performed (Study ALXN1840-HV-108) to demonstrate\
    \ that ALXN1840 can result in a change from baseline in copper balance with repeat-dose\
    \ ALXN1840 (30 mg/day) treatment.</p>\n<p>In the Phase 2 proof-of-concept Study\
    \ WTX101-201 in participants with WD, ALXN1840 demonstrated a sustained control\
    \ of free copper as measured by NCCc<span class=\"s11\">o</span><span class=\"\
    s12\">rr</span>ec<span class=\"s13\">t</span>e<span class=\"s11\">d</span> . Importantly,\
    \ ALXN1840 treatment resulted in improvements in disability and neurologic symptoms\
    \ as measured by the Unified Wilson Disease Rating Scale (UWDRS, Parts II and\
    \ III) and stabilization of liver function (Weiss, 2017). Treatment with ALXN1840\
    \ resulted in an acceptable safety and tolerability profile when initiated at\
    \ 15 mg daily with Investigator-driven, individual participant titration of dose\
    \ based on safety, NCCc<span class=\"s11\">o</span><span class=\"s12\">rr</span>ec<span\

    \ single-dose administration of 60 mg ALXN1840, total molybdenum peaked at approximately\
    \ 4.54 hours with a terminal elimination half-life measured at approximately 51\
    \ hours. In Study WTX101-201, the PK of ALXN1840, based on total molybdenum, indicated\
    \ that exposure in participants with WD at a dose of 30 mg appeared consistent\
    \ with previous results from healthy participants. The half-life was estimated\
    \ to be approximately 24 hours at steady state on Days 84 and 168 and was shorter\
    \ than estimated in previous studies. Based on a total molybdenum PK half-life\
    \ of approximately 24 - 51 hours, total molybdenum steady state may conservatively\

    \ standard of care therapies or ALXN1840) and treatment-na\xEFve participants\
    \ are eligible for this study. Eligible patients will be classified into one of\
    \ two cohorts:</p>\n<p>\u2022 Cohort 1 (treatment experienced): Patients who have\

    \ screening and enrollment, participants will check-in to the CRU on Day -8 for\
    \ the Run-in Period. The purpose of the Run-in Period is to support diet equilibration\
    \ (Day -7 through Day -5) and measure pretreatment copper and molybdenum balance\
    \ (Day -4 through Day -1). Participants will remain on a copper/molybdenum-controlled\
    \ diet throughout both the Inpatient Period 1 (Day -8 to Day 9) and Inpatient\
    \ Period 2 (Day 23 to Day 40). While not in the CRU, participants will be encouraged\
    \ to adhere to their usual copper-controlled diet.</p>\n<p>Participants who are\
    \ taking copper-chelating therapies (penicillamine or trientine) at the time of\
    \ enrollment will be discontinued from their decoppering therapies starting on\
    \ Day -4 to allow a baseline assessment of copper/molybdenum balance prior to\
    \ ALXN1840 treatment. On Day 1, participants will be initiated on 15 mg/day of\
    \ ALXN1840 for a treatment period of approximately 28 days followed by titration\
    \ up to 30 mg/day on Day 29. Before titration to 30 mg/day, the SRC will review\

    \ will have intake and output collection periods from Day -4 through Day -1, from\
    \ Day 1 through Day 8, and Day 25 through Day 39. The collection periods will\
    \ support an assessment of both copper and molybdenum balance (as a measure of\
    \ ALXN1840 ADME) at the 15 mg and 30 mg doses and will allow assessment of the\
    \ effects of duration of treatment on copper elimination and copper balance.</p>\n\
    <p>Collection periods for feces and urine will vary in duration from 3 to 15 days\
    \ to support assessment of both copper and molybdenum balance before and at steady\
    \ state for both 15 mg and 30 mg. Equilibration periods on copper/molybdenum-controlled\
    \ diets will be a minimum of 48 hours. Copper balance will be calculated as the\
    \ mean daily copper balance over each of the 4 collection periods. The interpretation\
    \ of copper balance will be based on the criteria established by Hill,1986 when\
    \ undertaking copper balance studies with zinc treatment. For assessment of ALXN1840\
    \ effect on copper balance, the time period for analysis will take into consideration\
    \ the average bowel transit of approximately 40 hours (male: 33 hours; female:\
    \ 47 hours) (Camilleri, 1986; Metcalf, 1987).</p>\n<p>Throughout the inpatient\
    \ periods, participants will remain on a copper-controlled diet. Meal portions\
    \ will be weighed, and meal sizes will be appropriate to support male and female\
    \ caloric consumption. Participants will be encouraged to complete 100% of all\
    \ meals throughout the inpatient period to support quantification of copper and\
    \ molybdenum intake. If participants are unable to complete the full meal, the\
    \ uneaten portion will be weighed to allow calculation of meal fraction, and copper\
    \ and molybdenum intake will be adjusted based on the fractional intake</p>\n\

  sectionTitle: Scientific Rationale for Study Design
  text: "<p>The study is designed as an open-label exploratory study to provide a\
    \ descriptive assessment of copper balance in participants with WD, the target\
    \ population for ALXN1840 therapy. The study is being conducted as a repeat-dose\
    \ study to assess the effect of duration of ALXN1840 treatment and the effects\
    \ of intra-patient dose increase on copper and molybdenum balance in participants\
    \ with WD. The intra-patient dose escalation schedule is similar to that employed\
    \ in the current Phase 3 Study WTX101-301. The similar schedule was chosen to\
    \ characterize the decoppering effects expected early with treatment. This study\
    \ is designed to supplement the mechanism of action study in healthy participants\
    \ (Study ALXN1840-HV-108). While healthy participants are expected to be adequate\
    \ to assess the mechanism of action of ALXN1840, characterization of copper balance\
    \ in the WD population will help to understand if there are differences in the\
    \ magnitude of effect between the 2 populations as this may be important to understand\
    \ the doses that may support a net neutral versus a net negative copper balance.\
    \ Limited nonclinical data on copper elimination with tetrathiomolybdate suggested\
    \ copper excretion may be at least maintained or increased with repeated dosing\
    \ (refer to the current IB).</p>\n<p>Page 27 of 74 \nAlexion Confidential</p>\n\
    <p class=\"p4\"> </p>\n<p>Protocol Amendment 3.1 (US) 18 Mar 2022</p>\n<p>ALXN184<span\
    \ class=\"s6\">0</span>-WD-204</p>\n<p>Therefore, the duration of the study and\
    \ multiple collection periods will better characterize the pattern of copper elimination\
    \ over time. Such information may be helpful in understanding the decoppering\
    \ and maintenance phases.</p>\n<p>As the study involves intensive diet control\
    \ and sampling, the study is planned to be conducted in a small number of participants\
    \ with WD who will be admitted to a CRU for 2 inpatient periods. Inpatient Period\
    \ 1 includes a baseline and initial 15 mg/day collection period during the accumulation\
    \ phase followed by an Outpatient Period; Inpatient Period 2 with a second collection\
    \ period to support analysis of copper balance at 15 mg/day steady state and a\
    \ 30 mg/day accumulation and steady state.</p>\n<p>During the Outpatient Period,\
    \ participants will be encouraged to remain on a copper-controlled diet; however,\
    \ to avoid confounding, a diet equilibration period is included in each study\
    \ period. Overall, collection periods are a minimum of 3 days and as long as 15\
    \ days (which will be subdivided for analyses). Collection periods of at least\
    \ 3 days were used to help minimize the impact of day-to-day variability on measurements.\
    \ In addition, the time period for analysis will take into consideration the average\
    \ bowel transit of approximately 40 hours (male: 33 hours; female: 47 hours) (Camilleri,\
    \ 1986; Metcalf, 1987). Because the periods are of different lengths, the study\
    \ will calculate mean daily copper balance.</p>\n<p>While the primary endpoint\
    \ for the study is an assessment of net copper balance, measurement of a pretreatment\
    \ copper baseline will be helpful to understand the magnitude of effect of ALXN1840.\
    \ To assess the copper baseline during the Inpatient Run-in Period, participants\
    \ will be discontinued from their chelator therapy for approximately 4 days prior\
    \ to initiating ALXN1840. During this period, participants will be maintained\
    \ on a copper-controlled diet to minimize risk to the participants. In the Phase\
    \ 3 study ALXN1840-WD-301, participants discontinue their chelator approximately\
    \ 48 hours prior to initiation of ALXN1840 without reported complications. Among\
    \ participants who discontinue chelator due to intolerance or noncompliance, the\
    \ time from chelator discontinuation to the onset or worsening of symptoms varies\
    \ from as little as 1 or 2 weeks to as long as months or years (Scheinberg, 1987).\
    \ To prevent confounding of the study results, participants must be off zinc therapy\
    \ for a minimum of 21 days prior to Day 1 because zinc works through upregulation\
    \ of metallothionein (MT) in enterocytes resulting in elevation of fecal copper\
    \ excretion. Previously, reports in the literature suggest that it can take up\
    \ to 3 weeks or longer for zinc treatment to have an efficacious effect on copper\
    \ balance (Brewer, 1983), so a delayed time to reversal of this effect could also\
    \ occur. However, the physiologic turnover of human gastrointestinal epithelial\
    \ cells is 3 - 5 days (Darwich, 2014); therefore, the inhibitory effect of zinc\
    \ on intestinal copper absorption is expected to be minimal 21 days after discontinuation\
    \ of zinc.</p>\n<p>Following ALXN1840 administration, the active drug moiety tetrathiomolybdate\
    \ rapidly binds copper to form TPC, mostly in the liver and blood, and presents\
    \ as such in the systemic circulation. If TPC is not rapidly formed, tetrathiomolybdate\
    \ spontaneously undergoes serial hydrolysis to form molybdate, the most common\
    \ form of nutrient molybdenum, and is excreted in the urine. Total molybdenum\
    \ concentration has been measured as a surrogate of ALXN1840 PK; however, total\
    \ molybdenum concentration cannot distinguish whether the molybdenum is protein\
    \ bound (mostly as TPC), free active drug as ALXN1840, intermediate hydrolysis\
    \ products, or molybdate. To better characterize the amount of non-TPC-bound drug\
    \ and its unbound degradation products, plasma PUF-molybdenum has also been measured,\
    \ which</p>\n<p>Page 28 of 74 \nAlexion Confidential</p>\n<p class=\"p4\"> </p>\n\

    <p>represents the free parent drug (ALXN1840), short-lived intermediate hydrolysis\
    \ products, and molybdate, which may have originated from the tetrathiomolybdate\
    \ or from food intake as a micronutrient. Total molybdenum PK and free molybdenum\
    \ PK serve as surrogate measures of ALXN1840 PK. To better characterize the ADME\
    \ of ALXN1840, the PK of both total molybdenum and PUF-molybdenum will be characterized\
    \ and described.</p>\n<p>This study is designed to provide an extensive assessment\
    \ of copper and molybdenum balance over the first 40 days of treatment with ALXN1840\
    \ and support a more robust understanding of the effects of duration of treatment\
    \ and dose of ALXN1840 on copper balance. Half-life estimates for total molybdenum\
    \ in Study WTX101-201 were reported to be approximately 24 hours at steady state\
    \ on Days 84 and 168, while in healthy participants, total molybdenum half-life\
    \ was measured closer to 51 hours. With a half-life within this range, the sample\
    \ collection periods include assessment of copper and molybdenum balance both\
    \ during accumulation and at steady state for both the 15 mg/day and 30 mg/day\
    \ doses. The study will include both intake and output collection as well as PK\
    \ and copper assessments (ie, ceruloplasmin-bound copper and labile bound copper\
    \ [LBC]) to inform the relationship between balance measurements and copper and\
    \ molybdenum levels in the blood.</p>\n<p>Finally, preclinical data from ALXN1840\
    \ ADME study suggest the potential for molybdenum accumulation in the liver of\
    \ participants with WD; therefore, an assessment of molybdenum balance will help\
    \ determine whether steady state has been reached as defined by a molybdenum balance\
    \ of neutral during the collection period. Because molybdenum is a necessary micronutrient\
    \ and serves as a cofactor for a number of enzymes and may exist in intracellular\
    \ stores, small variations in molybdenum balance could be due to molybdate rather\
    \ than ALXN1840.</p>\n<p><b>4.2.1. Participant Input into Design</b></p>\n<p>Not\

    \ profile and be well-tolerated in healthy male and female participants in the\
    \ Phase 1 bioavailability Studies WTX101-101 and WTX101-102. In addition, preliminary\
    \ data from Study WTX101-106 have also shown ALXN1840 to be well tolerated in\
    \ healthy Japanese and non-Japanese male and female participants at a single dose\
    \ of 15 mg or 60 mg. While no repeat-dose studies have been performed in healthy\

    \ to the Phase 2 study, in Study WTX101-301, participants are started at a dose\
    \ of 15 mg/day and, after review of all safety information, participants may be\
    \ titrated up to 30 mg/day after approximately 4 weeks. Based on the results of\
    \ Study WTX101-201, doses ranging from 15 mg/day to 60 mg/day were adequate to\
    \ significantly decrease non-ceruloplasmin corrected copper concentrations corrected\

    \ class=\"s13\">t</span>e<span class=\"s11\">d</span> ) and, in many cases, return\
    \ the NCC to normal concentrations of copper control. Given the robust improvement\
    \ in copper control, it is hypothesized that doses within the 15 to 30 mg/day\
    \ range will be adequate to drive a net negative copper balance. The current study\
    \ will explore copper balance in response to treatment with ALXN1840, with the\
    \ purpose of informing the dose and dosing duration required to result in adequate\
    \ copper elimination to drive a measurable net negative copper balance. Copper\
    \ balance will be assessed for the 15 mg/day dose at the beginning and end of\
    \ the 15 mg/day treatment period, and at the beginning of the 30 mg/day treatment\
    \ period. Copper balance will be assessed for the 30 mg/day dose at Days 31 through\
    \ 35 and Days 36 through 39. The multiple collection periods will support assessment\
    \ of duration of treatment and dose on copper elimination and overall copper balance.</p>\n\
    <p>In this study, dosing for ALXN1840 will be initiated at 15 mg once daily for\
    \ a minimum of 4 weeks, with an increase to 30 mg after 4 weeks, unless there\

    \ 18 Mar 2022</p>\n<p>ALXN184<span class=\"s6\">0</span>-WD-204</p>\n<p>The primary\
    \ analysis will be performed using the Full Analysis Set. Average daily copper\
    \ balance and molybdenum balance will be calculated over the following periods:</p>\n\
    <p>1.</p>\n<p>2.</p>\n<p>3.</p>\n<p>4.</p>\n<p>5.</p>\n<p>Day -4 through Day -1\
    \ representing predose baseline Days 1 through 8 representing the ALXN1840 15\

    \ accumulation period Days 36 through 39 representing the ALXN1840 30 mg/day steady-state\
    \ period</p>\n<p>As ALXN1840 is expected to increase copper excretion through\
    \ fecal excretion, copper in stool will be critical for determining copper balance.\
    \ Because stools can be irregular, assessment of copper and molybdenum balance\
    \ will only include data up to the day of the final bowel movement. For example,\
    \ for the period Day 1 through Day 8, if the final bowel movement occurs on Day\
    \ 7, average daily copper balance for the Day 1 through Day 8 period will only\
    \ include data from Day 1 through Day 7.</p>\n<p>In the case of the 15 mg/day\
    \ steady-state period (ie, Day 25 through Day 28), stool data collected on Days\
    \ 29 - 30 samples may be used if needed to support assessments for the 15 mg/day\
    \ dose. Use of these stool data (as needed) are consistent with an approximately\
    \ 2-day gastrointestinal transit time.</p>\n<p>In the case of stool irregularity,\
    \ and to support assessment of copper output over time, bowel movement copper\
    \ and molybdenum outputs may be averaged over the days between bowel movement\
    \ (or start of study) to ensure an approximate value for each 24-hour period.</p>\n\
