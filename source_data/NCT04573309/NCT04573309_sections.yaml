    <p> </p>\n<p>Protocol Title: A Phase 2, Open-label Study to Assess Copper and\
    \ Molybdenum Balance in Participants with Wilson Disease Treated with ALXN1840\
    \ Short Title: Copper and Molybdenum Balance in Participants with Wilson Disease\
    \ Treated with ALXN1840</p>\n<p>Rationale:</p>\n<p>The principal aim of this exploratory\
    \ study is to investigate the effects of ALXN1840 on copper balance in participants\
    \ with Wilson disease (WD). The study will specifically evaluate the effects of\
    \ 2 different ALXN1840 doses as well as the duration of treatment on copper balance\
    \ to further elucidate the dose response of \u201Cdecoppering\u201D versus \u201C\
    maintenance\u201D dose in participants with WD.</p>\n<p>The secondary aim of the\
    \ study is to characterize the steady-state absorption, distribution, metabolism,\
    \ and excretion (ADME; mass balance) of total molybdenum which is a surrogate\
    \ measure of ALXN1840 disposition in participants with WD.</p>\n<p>ALXN1840 contains\
    \ the active anion tetrathiomolybdate and has been shown to cause negative copper\
    \ balance when administered to healthy animals as well as decopper the liver in\
    \ animal models of WD. In Study WTX101-201, which assessed the safety and efficacy\
    \ of ALXN1840 in participants with WD, ALXN1840 demonstrated enhanced copper control\
    \ as measured by reduced plasma non-ceruloplasmin-bound copper (NCC) corrected\
    \ (NCCc<span class=\"s11\">o</span><span class=\"s12\">rr</span>ec<span class=\"\
    s13\">t</span>e<span class=\"s11\">d</span> ) for the stable tetrathiomolybdate-\
    \ copper -albumin tripartite complex (TPC).</p>\n<p>Depletion of copper by ALXN1840\
    \ has been shown to occur primarily through fecal elimination in both healthy\
    \ and WD animal models. In this study, copper balance will be calculated as the\
    \ difference between measured copper input in food and drink and measured copper\
    \ output in urine and feces. This method is classically considered the most objective\
    \ measure of decoppering ability with a decoppering agent able to drive a net\
    \ negative copper balance.</p>\n<p>As part of the secondary objective, to confirm\
    \ that ALXN1840 steady state is adequately characterized by the plasma pharmacokinetics\
    \ (PK), a molybdenum mass balance assessment will be performed at predicted steady\
    \ state for the 15 mg/day and 30 mg/day doses: if steady state is achieved, molybdenum(out)\
    \ will equal molybdenum(in). This approach may also detect potential accumulation\
    \ in the liver or other tissues of participants with WD.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Objectives\
    \ and Endpoints</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Overall Design This is a single-arm, open-label,\
    \ repeat-dose study to evaluate the effects of ALXN1840 administration on copper\
    \ balance in participants with WD. The safety and tolerability of ALXN1840 in\
    \ participants with WD will also be assessed. ALXN1840 PK in plasma as measured\
    \ via total molybdenum and plasma ultrafiltrate (PUF) molybdenum will be determined\
    \ after repeated dosing along with total molybdenum mass balance at steady state.</p>\n\
    <p>Disclosure Statemen<span class=\"s14\">t</span>: This is an ope<span class=\"\
    s14\">n</span>-label, 3-period study with 1 arm. Number of Participants:</p>\n\
    <p>The sample size will be approximately 10 participants which will allow a general\
    \ characterization of copper balance in response to ALXN1840.</p>\n<p><span class=\"\

    \ consent form (ICF), are eligible for the study, and are registered on Day -7\
    \ when participants are assigned a participant number.</p>\n<p>Intervention Groups\
    \ and Duration:</p>\n<p>Treatment-experienced (which includes standard of care\
    \ therapies or ALXN1840) and treatment-na\xEFve participants are eligible for\
    \ this study. Following screening and enrollment, participants will have a Run-in\
    \ Period to support diet equilibration (Day -7 through Day -5) and measurement\
    \ of pretreatment copper and molybdenum balance (Day -4 through Day -1). Following\
    \ the Run-in Period, participants will be administered ALXN1840 at 15 mg/day for\
    \ a treatment period of approximately 28 days followed by titration up to 30 mg/day\
    \ on Day 29. Before titration to 30 mg/day, the Safety Review Committee (SRC)\
    \ will review available safety data through Day 23 for each participant.</p>\n\
    <p>Participants will have intake and output collection periods from Day -4 through\
    \ Day -1, from Day 1 through Day 8 (initial 15 mg/day collection period), and\
    \ Day 25 through Day 39. The collection periods will support an assessment of\
    \ both copper and molybdenum balance (as a measure of ALXN1840 ADME) at the 15\
    \ mg/day and 30 mg/day doses and will allow assessment of the effects of duration\
    \ of treatment on copper elimination and copper balance.</p>\n<p>Participants\
    \ may be discharged from the clinical research unit (CRU) on Day 9 to return on\
    \ Day 22 or Day 23 (predose); all procedures will start on Day 23. To ensure flexibility,\
    \ the Outpatient Period during Treatment Period 1 may be extended up to an additional\
    \ 14 days with Investigator approval. In this situation, participants will be\
    \ given additional investigational product to support daily dosing throughout\
    \ the Outpatient Period. In such cases, the actual Outpatient Period</p>\n<p>\
    \ </p>\n<p>duration will be recorded and the participant will continue Inpatient\
    \ Period 2 at Day 23. During the Outpatient Period, participants will use SMS\
    \ text messaging to confirm study intervention administration. At the CRU's discretion,\
    \ participants may remain in the CRU during the outpatient period for safety or\
    \ to maintain the integrity of the conduct of the study.</p>\n<p>Safety Review\
    \ Committee:</p>\n<p>A Safety Review Committee (SRC), composed of a minimum of\
    \ the Investigator, Alexion Medical Monitor, and Alexion Safety Physician, will\
    \ meet at the end of 15 mg/day dosing to confirm proceeding to 30 mg/day and as\
    \ necessary based on any emerging safety concerns.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span class=\"\

    \ in participants with WD and other indications. Ammonium tetrathiomolybdate and\
    \ bis-choline tetrathiomolybdate nonclinical and clinical data reported to date\
    \ support the efficacy and safety of ALXN1840.</p>\n<p>ALXN1840 rapidly forms\
    \ stable tetrathiomolybdate-copper-albumin TPCs, which stabilize free copper leading\
    \ to a reduction in the NCC concentrations after correction for free copper bound\
    \ to TPC (NCCc<span class=\"s11\">o</span><span class=\"s12\">rr</span>ec<span\
    \ class=\"s13\">t</span>e<span class=\"s11\">d</span> ).</p>\n<p>Studies in both\
    \ healthy and WD animal models showed that treatment with tetrathiomolybdate results\
    \ in removal of copper from the liver. Tetrathiomolybdate administered to healthy\
    \ mice by intraperitoneal injection resulted in a dose-dependent reduction in\
    \ liver copper concentration over a treatment range of 0 - 6 mg/kg/day (human\
    \ equivalent dose [HED] by body surface area [BSA] scaling: 0 - 1 mg/kg/day).\
    \ The results of these studies indicated that only 30% \u2011 40% of copper remained\
    \ after 5 weeks of treatment. Similar liver decoppering (approximately 40% - 60%)\
    \ was also reported in toxic milk mice (a WD animal model) at 5 mg/kg/ day for\
    \ 14 days (HED by BSA scaling: 0.4 mg/kg/day; Mills, 1981; Czachor, 2002). In\
    \ LEC WD model rats, 25 mg/kg/day of ALXN1840 (HED by BSA scaling: 4 mg/kg/day)\
    \ administered by oral gavage for 10 days, resulted in an approximately 50% decrease\
    \ in liver copper concentration. Because ALXN1840 has been shown to have a similar\
    \ mechanism of action in healthy and WD animal models, a mechanism of action study\
    \ in healthy participants is being performed (Study ALXN1840-HV-108) to demonstrate\
    \ that ALXN1840 can result in a change from baseline in copper balance with repeat-dose\
    \ ALXN1840 (30 mg/day) treatment.</p>\n<p>In the Phase 2 proof-of-concept Study\
    \ WTX101-201 in participants with WD, ALXN1840 demonstrated a sustained control\
    \ of free copper as measured by NCCc<span class=\"s11\">o</span><span class=\"\
    s12\">rr</span>ec<span class=\"s13\">t</span>e<span class=\"s11\">d</span> . Importantly,\
    \ ALXN1840 treatment resulted in improvements in disability and neurologic symptoms\
    \ as measured by the Unified Wilson Disease Rating Scale (UWDRS, Parts II and\
    \ III) and stabilization of liver function (Weiss, 2017). Treatment with ALXN1840\
    \ resulted in an acceptable safety and tolerability profile when initiated at\
    \ 15 mg daily with Investigator-driven, individual participant titration of dose\
    \ based on safety, NCCc<span class=\"s11\">o</span><span class=\"s12\">rr</span>ec<span\
    \ class=\"s13\">t</span>e<span class=\"s11\">d</span> , and symptoms.</p>\n<p>Following\
    \ single-dose administration of 60 mg ALXN1840, total molybdenum peaked at approximately\
    \ 4.54 hours with a terminal elimination half-life measured at approximately 51\
    \ hours. In Study WTX101-201, the PK of ALXN1840, based on total molybdenum, indicated\
    \ that exposure in participants with WD at a dose of 30 mg appeared consistent\
    \ with previous results from healthy participants. The half-life was estimated\
    \ to be approximately 24 hours at steady state on Days 84 and 168 and was shorter\
    \ than estimated in previous studies. Based on a total molybdenum PK half-life\
    \ of approximately 24 - 51 hours, total molybdenum steady state may conservatively\
    \ be reached within approximately 10 - 12 days. Nevertheless, results (as</p>\n\
    <p> </p>\n<p>measured by total molybdenum) obtained from the ALXN1840 balance\
    \ study in the LEC WD rat model suggested that approximately 30% of a single dose\
    \ of ALXN1840 remained in the liver by Day 7, indicating the possibility of tissue\
    \ accumulation, particularly in the setting of high liver copper concentration\
    \ (Plitz, 2019).</p>\n<p>If the half-life of ALXN1840 in liver were longer than\
    \ that of the systemic compartment, the accumulation may not be readily detected\
    \ in the absence of a longer treatment period and with characterization of the\
    \ terminal elimination period. An alternative approach to assessing steady state\
    \ using total molybdenum PK is to assess whether the total molybdenum intake is\
    \ equal to the total molybdenum output; this approach may detect any significant\
    \ ongoing accumulation in the liver or other tissues.</p>\n<p>Detailed descriptions\

    \ balance in participants with WD.</p>\n<p>Treatment-experienced (which includes\
    \ standard of care therapies or ALXN1840) and treatment-na\xEFve participants\
    \ are eligible for this study. Eligible patients will be classified into one of\
    \ two cohorts:</p>\n<p><span class=\"s15\">\u2022</span> Cohort 1 (treatment experienced):\
    \ Patients who have received WD therapy for &gt; 28 days</p>\n<p><span class=\"\

    \ will check-in to the CRU on Day -8 for the Run-in Period. The purpose of the\
    \ Run-in Period is to support diet equilibration (Day -7 through Day -5) and measure\
    \ pretreatment copper and molybdenum balance (Day -4 through Day -1). Participants\
    \ will remain on a copper/molybdenum-controlled diet throughout both the Inpatient\
    \ Period 1 (Day -8 to Day 9) and Inpatient Period 2 (Day 23 to Day 40). While\
    \ not in the CRU, participants will be encouraged to adhere to their usual copper-controlled\
    \ diet.</p>\n<p>Participants who are taking copper-chelating therapies (penicillamine\
    \ or trientine) at the time of enrollment will be discontinued from their decoppering\
    \ therapies starting on Day -4 to allow a baseline assessment of copper/molybdenum\
    \ balance prior to ALXN1840 treatment. On Day 1, participants will be initiated\
    \ on 15 mg/day of ALXN1840 for a treatment period of approximately 28 days followed\
    \ by titration up to 30 mg/day on Day 29. Before titration to 30 mg/day, the SRC\
    \ will review available safety data through Day 23 for each participant.</p>\n\
    <p>Participants will have intake and output collection periods from Day -4 through\
    \ Day -1, from Day 1 through Day 8, and Day 25 through Day 39. The collection\
    \ periods will support an assessment of both copper and molybdenum balance (as\
    \ a measure of ALXN1840 ADME) at the 15 mg and 30 mg doses and will allow assessment\
    \ of the effects of duration of treatment on copper elimination and copper balance.</p>\n\
    <p>Collection periods for feces and urine will vary in duration from 3 to 15 days\
    \ to support assessment of both copper and molybdenum balance before and at steady\
    \ state for both 15 mg and 30 mg. Equilibration periods on copper/molybdenum-controlled\
    \ diets will be a minimum of 48 hours. Copper balance will be calculated as the\
    \ mean daily copper balance over each of the 4 collection periods. The interpretation\
    \ of copper balance will be based on the criteria established by Hill,1986 when\
    \ undertaking copper balance studies with zinc treatment. For assessment of ALXN1840\
    \ effect on copper balance, the time period for analysis will take into consideration\
    \ the average bowel transit of approximately 40 hours (male: 33 hours; female:\
    \ 47 hours) (Camilleri, 1986; Metcalf, 1987).</p>\n<p>Throughout the inpatient\
    \ periods, participants will remain on a copper-controlled diet. Meal portions\
    \ will be weighed, and meal sizes will be appropriate to support male and female\
    \ caloric consumption. Participants will be encouraged to complete 100% of all\
    \ meals throughout the inpatient period to support quantification of copper and\
    \ molybdenum intake. If participants are unable to complete the full meal, the\
    \ uneaten portion will be weighed to allow calculation of meal fraction, and copper\
    \ and molybdenum intake will be adjusted based on the fractional intake</p>\n\
    <p> </p>\n<p>of the meal. In addition to food, fluid intake and type will be measured\
    \ and recorded each day. Samples of all meals and fluids will be sent for bioanalysis\
    \ to support accurate quantification of copper and molybdenum in fluids. In the\
    \ event that items cannot be accurately quantified, items may be balanced during\
    \ pretreatment period and post-treatment period to support the change from baseline\
    \ assessment.</p>\n<p>During the inpatient collection periods, daily urine will\
    \ be pooled (24-hour collection) with volumes recorded for each 24-hour period;\
    \ participants will be strongly encouraged to void within 2 hours of completion\
    \ of each 24-hour period (ie, dosing time). Stool samples will be individually\
    \ collected and each sample will include a collection date, time, and weight.</p>\n\
    <p>Participants may be discharged from the CRU on Day 9 and return on Day 22 or\
    \ Day 23 (predose); all procedures will start on Day 23. To ensure flexibility,\
    \ the Outpatient Period during Treatment Period 1 may be extended up to an additional\
    \ 14 days with Investigator approval. In this situation, participants will be\
    \ given additional investigational product to support daily dosing throughout\
    \ the Outpatient Period. In such cases, the actual Outpatient Period duration\
    \ will be recorded and the participant will continue Inpatient Period 2 at Day\
    \ 23. During the Outpatient Period, participants will use SMS text messaging to\
    \ confirm study intervention administration. At the CRU's discretion, participants\
    \ may remain in the CRU during the outpatient period for safety or to maintain\
    \ the integrity of the conduct of the study.</p>\n<p>Blood sampling for PK/pharmacodynamic\
    \ (PD) will occur over the 24-hour dosing period on Days 1, 25, 29, and 39. Predose\
    \ PK samples will be collected at all time points during the intake and output\
    \ collection period to help characterize PK during accumulation (Days 1 through\
    \ 9 for 15 mg and Days 31 through 35 for 30 mg) and at steady state (Days 25 through\
    \ 28 for 15 mg and Days 36 through 39 for 30 mg).</p>\n<p>This study incorporates\
    \ the use of an adaptive design. Adaptive features may be implemented at the discretion\
    \ of the Investigator to support conduct of the study. Such adaptive features\
    \ do not require amendment of the protocol. Adaptive features and their limits\
    \ are described in Table 4.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Table 4. Adaptive Protocol Features</p>\n\
    <p>The study is designed as an open-label exploratory study to provide a descriptive\
    \ assessment of copper balance in participants with WD, the target population\
    \ for ALXN1840 therapy. The study is being conducted as a repeat-dose study to\
    \ assess the effect of duration of ALXN1840 treatment and the effects of intra-patient\
    \ dose increase on copper and molybdenum balance in participants with WD. The\
    \ intra-patient dose escalation schedule is similar to that employed in the current\
    \ Phase 3 Study WTX101-301. The similar schedule was chosen to characterize the\
    \ decoppering effects expected early with treatment. This study is designed to\
    \ supplement the mechanism of action study in healthy participants (Study ALXN1840-HV-108).\
    \ While healthy participants are expected to be adequate to assess the mechanism\
    \ of action of ALXN1840, characterization of copper balance in the WD population\
    \ will help to understand if there are differences in the magnitude of effect\
    \ between the 2 populations as this may be important to understand the doses that\
    \ may support a net neutral versus a net negative copper balance. Limited nonclinical\
    \ data on copper elimination with tetrathiomolybdate suggested copper excretion\
    \ may be at least maintained or increased with repeated dosing (refer to the current\
    \ IB).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Therefore, the duration of the study and multiple collection\
    \ periods will better characterize the pattern of copper elimination over time.\
    \ Such information may be helpful in understanding the decoppering and maintenance\
    \ phases.</p>\n<p>As the study involves intensive diet control and sampling, the\
    \ study is planned to be conducted in a small number of participants with WD who\
    \ will be admitted to a CRU for 2 inpatient periods. Inpatient Period 1 includes\
    \ a baseline and initial 15 mg/day collection period during the accumulation phase\
    \ followed by an Outpatient Period; Inpatient Period 2 with a second collection\
    \ period to support analysis of copper balance at 15 mg/day steady state and a\
    \ 30 mg/day accumulation and steady state.</p>\n<p>During the Outpatient Period,\
    \ participants will be encouraged to remain on a copper-controlled diet; however,\
    \ to avoid confounding, a diet equilibration period is included in each study\
    \ period. Overall, collection periods are a minimum of 3 days and as long as 15\
    \ days (which will be subdivided for analyses). Collection periods of at least\
    \ 3 days were used to help minimize the impact of day-to-day variability on measurements.\
    \ In addition, the time period for analysis will take into consideration the average\
    \ bowel transit of approximately 40 hours (male: 33 hours; female: 47 hours) (Camilleri,\
    \ 1986; Metcalf, 1987). Because the periods are of different lengths, the study\
    \ will calculate mean daily copper balance.</p>\n<p>While the primary endpoint\
    \ for the study is an assessment of net copper balance, measurement of a pretreatment\
    \ copper baseline will be helpful to understand the magnitude of effect of ALXN1840.\
    \ To assess the copper baseline during the Inpatient Run-in Period, participants\
    \ will be discontinued from their chelator therapy for approximately 4 days prior\
    \ to initiating ALXN1840. During this period, participants will be maintained\
    \ on a copper-controlled diet to minimize risk to the participants. In the Phase\
    \ 3 study ALXN1840-WD-301, participants discontinue their chelator approximately\
    \ 48 hours prior to initiation of ALXN1840 without reported complications. Among\
    \ participants who discontinue chelator due to intolerance or noncompliance, the\
    \ time from chelator discontinuation to the onset or worsening of symptoms varies\
    \ from as little as 1 or 2 weeks to as long as months or years (Scheinberg, 1987).\
    \ To prevent confounding of the study results, participants must be off zinc therapy\
    \ for a minimum of 21 days prior to Day 1 because zinc works through upregulation\
    \ of metallothionein (MT) in enterocytes resulting in elevation of fecal copper\
    \ excretion. Previously, reports in the literature suggest that it can take up\
    \ to 3 weeks or longer for zinc treatment to have an efficacious effect on copper\
    \ balance (Brewer, 1983), so a delayed time to reversal of this effect could also\
    \ occur. However, the physiologic turnover of human gastrointestinal epithelial\
    \ cells is 3 - 5 days (Darwich, 2014); therefore, the inhibitory effect of zinc\
    \ on intestinal copper absorption is expected to be minimal 21 days after discontinuation\
    \ of zinc.</p>\n<p>Following ALXN1840 administration, the active drug moiety tetrathiomolybdate\
    \ rapidly binds copper to form TPC, mostly in the liver and blood, and presents\
    \ as such in the systemic circulation. If TPC is not rapidly formed, tetrathiomolybdate\
    \ spontaneously undergoes serial hydrolysis to form molybdate, the most common\
    \ form of nutrient molybdenum, and is excreted in the urine. Total molybdenum\
    \ concentration has been measured as a surrogate of ALXN1840 PK; however, total\
    \ molybdenum concentration cannot distinguish whether the molybdenum is protein\
    \ bound (mostly as TPC), free active drug as ALXN1840, intermediate hydrolysis\
    \ products, or molybdate. To better characterize the amount of non-TPC-bound drug\
    \ and its unbound degradation products, plasma PUF-molybdenum has also been measured,\
    \ which</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>represents the free parent drug (ALXN1840), short-lived\
    \ intermediate hydrolysis products, and molybdate, which may have originated from\
    \ the tetrathiomolybdate or from food intake as a micronutrient. Total molybdenum\
    \ PK and free molybdenum PK serve as surrogate measures of ALXN1840 PK. To better\
    \ characterize the ADME of ALXN1840, the PK of both total molybdenum and PUF-molybdenum\
    \ will be characterized and described.</p>\n<p>This study is designed to provide\
    \ an extensive assessment of copper and molybdenum balance over the first 40 days\
    \ of treatment with ALXN1840 and support a more robust understanding of the effects\
    \ of duration of treatment and dose of ALXN1840 on copper balance. Half-life estimates\
    \ for total molybdenum in Study WTX101-201 were reported to be approximately 24\
    \ hours at steady state on Days 84 and 168, while in healthy participants, total\
    \ molybdenum half-life was measured closer to 51 hours. With a half-life within\
    \ this range, the sample collection periods include assessment of copper and molybdenum\
    \ balance both during accumulation and at steady state for both the 15 mg/day\
    \ and 30 mg/day doses. The study will include both intake and output collection\
    \ as well as PK and copper assessments (ie, ceruloplasmin-bound copper and labile\
    \ bound copper [LBC]) to inform the relationship between balance measurements\
    \ and copper and molybdenum levels in the blood.</p>\n<p>Finally, preclinical\
    \ data from ALXN1840 ADME study suggest the potential for molybdenum accumulation\
    \ in the liver of participants with WD; therefore, an assessment of molybdenum\
    \ balance will help determine whether steady state has been reached as defined\
    \ by a molybdenum balance of neutral during the collection period. Because molybdenum\
    \ is a necessary micronutrient and serves as a cofactor for a number of enzymes\
    \ and may exist in intracellular stores, small variations in molybdenum balance\
    \ could be due to molybdate rather than ALXN1840.</p>"

    <p>ALXN1840 (bis-choline tetrathiomolybdate; formerly known as WTX101) is a novel\
    \ copper binding agent in development for the treatment of WD.</p>\n<p>The principal\
    \ aim of this exploratory study is to investigate the effects of ALXN1840 on copper\
    \ balance in participants with WD. The study will specifically evaluate the effects\
    \ of 2 different ALXN1840 dose levels as well as the duration of treatment on\
    \ copper balance to further elucidate the dose response of \u201Cdecoppering\u201D\
    \ versus \u201Cmaintenance\u201D dose in participants with WD.</p>\n<p>ALXN1840\
    \ contains the active anion tetrathiomolybdate and has been shown to cause negative\
    \ copper balance when administered to healthy animals as well as decopper the\
    \ liver in animal models of WD (Mills, 1981; Czachor, 2002). In Study WTX101-201,\
    \ which assessed the safety and efficacy of ALXN1840 in participants with WD,\
    \ ALXN1840 demonstrated enhanced copper control as measured by reduced plasma\
    \ NCCc<span class=\"s11\">o</span><span class=\"s12\">rr</span>ec<span class=\"\
    s13\">t</span>e<span class=\"s11\">d</span> for the stable tetrathiomolybdatecopper-albumin\
    \ TPC (Weiss, 2017).</p>\n<p>Depletion of copper by ALXN1840 has been shown to\
    \ occur primarily through fecal elimination in both healthy and WD animal models.\
    \ Sheep injected with 30 mg/day of tetrathiomolybdate for 5 days were shown to\
    \ have an elevation of fecal copper during the treatment period increasing from\
    \ a baseline of approximately 3 mg/day up to approximately 7 mg/day during the\
    \ treatment period, before returning to baseline concentrations (Mason, 1988).\
    \ Similarly, when Long-Evans Cinnamon (LEC) WD model rats were injected intraperitoneally\
    \ with a saline solution of tetrathiomolybdate at a dose of 10 mg/kg body weight\
    \ for 8 consecutive days, the amounts of both copper and molybdenum excreted into\
    \ the feces increased significantly (Ogra, 2000), which may suggest that copper\
    \ is excreted in a complex with tetrathiomolybdate into the feces. While fecal\
    \ copper increases with tetrathiomolybdate, the amount of copper excreted into\
    \ the urine decreased and that of molybdenum increased significantly during treatment\
    \ with tetrathiomolybdate. Molybdenum in the urine was molybdate which does not\
    \ bind copper (data on file). These findings are in line with other studies showing\
    \ enhanced biliary and/or fecal excretion of copper and molybdenum upon administration\
    \ of tetrathiomolybdate in rats and sheep (Komatsu, 2000; Ogra, 1995; Mason, 1988).</p>\n\
    <p>We hypothesize that repeated doses of ALXN1840 may drive a net negative copper\
    \ balance in participants with WD by increasing fecal excretion of copper. In\
    \ this study, copper balance will be calculated as the difference between measured\
    \ copper input in food and drink and measured copper output in urine and feces.\
    \ This method is classically considered the most objective measure of decoppering\
    \ ability with a decoppering agent able to drive a net negative copper balance\
    \ (Hill,1986; Strickland, 1971; Walshe, 1973). The purpose of this study is to\
    \ provide additional descriptive characterization of the effect of ALXN1840 on\
    \ copper balance in participants with WD. Further data obtained may help support\
    \ characterization of a \u201Cdecoppering\u201D versus \u201Cmaintenance\u201D\
    \ dose of ALXN1840, where a decoppering dose would be a dose sufficient to drive\
    \ a net negative copper balance and maintenance would support a more neutral copper\
    \ balance.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The secondary aim of the study is to characterize\
    \ the steady-state ADME (mass balance) of total molybdenum as a surrogate measure\
    \ of ALXN1840 disposition in participants with WD. To confirm that steady state\
    \ is adequately characterized by the plasma PK, a molybdenum mass balance assessment\
    \ will be performed on Day 25 through Day 28 for the 15 mg/day dose and Day 36\
    \ through Day 39 for the 30 mg/day dose: if steady state is achieved, molybdenum(out)\
    \ will equal molybdenum(in).</p>"

    <p>ALXN1840 at 60 mg single dose has been shown to have an adequate safety profile
    and be well-tolerated in healthy male and female participants in the Phase 1 bioavailability
    Studies WTX101-101 and WTX101-102. In addition, preliminary data from Study WTX101-106
    have also shown ALXN1840 to be well tolerated in healthy Japanese and non-Japanese
    male and female participants at a single dose of 15 mg or 60 mg. While no repeat-dose
    studies have been performed in healthy participants, bis-choline tetrathiomolybdate
    (ALXN1840) has been tested in a range of oncologic indications with a maximum
    tolerated dose of 300 mg/day (Lowndes, 2008).</p>

    <p>In the Phase 2 Study WTX101-201 conducted in participants with WD, the daily
    ALXN1840 doses were 15 mg for 6 (21%) participants, 30 mg for 13 (46%) participants,
    and 60 mg (32%) for 9 participants at Week 24 when the primary endpoint assessment
    was conducted, or at the last dose received for participants with early discontinuation.
    The 15 to 60 mg/day dose range has been demonstrated to be efficacious with a
    favorable safety profile in treating participants with WD (Weiss, 2017). Based
    on these Phase 2 study results, the ongoing Phase 3 Study WTX101-301 in participants
    with WD has been testing the efficacy and safety of ALXN1840 at</p>

    <p> </p>

    <p>a dose titration range from 15 mg to 60 mg daily with data to date supporting
    an acceptable safety profile.</p>

    <p>Similar to the Phase 2 study, in Study WTX101-301, participants are started
    at a dose of 15 mg/day and, after review of all safety information, participants
    may be titrated up to 30 mg/day after approximately 4 weeks. Based on the results
    of Study WTX101-201, doses ranging from 15 mg/day to 60 mg/day were adequate to
    significantly decrease non-ceruloplasmin corrected copper concentrations corrected
    for TPC (NCCc<span class="s11">o</span><span class="s12">rr</span>ec<span class="s13">t</span>e<span
    class="s11">d</span> ) and, in many cases, return the NCC to normal concentrations
    of copper control. Given the robust improvement in copper control, it is hypothesized
    that doses within the 15 to 30 mg/day range will be adequate to drive a net negative
    copper balance. The current study will explore copper balance in response to treatment
    with ALXN1840, with the purpose of informing the dose and dosing duration required
    to result in adequate copper elimination to drive a measurable net negative copper
    balance. Copper balance will be assessed for the 15 mg/day dose at the beginning
    and end of the 15 mg/day treatment period, and at the beginning of the 30 mg/day
    treatment period. Copper balance will be assessed for the 30 mg/day dose at Days
    31 through 35 and Days 36 through 39. The multiple collection periods will support
    assessment of duration of treatment and dose on copper elimination and overall
    copper balance.</p>

    <p>In this study, dosing for ALXN1840 will be initiated at 15 mg once daily for
    a minimum of 4 weeks, with an increase to 30 mg after 4 weeks, unless there are
    safety concerns that, in the opinion of the Investigator(s) and/or Alexion, may
    place participants at undue risk, in which case, participants may remain on the
    15 mg/day dose for the duration of the study. Further dose adjustments will be
    made as appropriate.</p>

    <p>The dose should be decreased or interrupted if any of the relevant Dose Modification
    Criteria are met. Deviation from the dose modification guidelines must be agreed
    with the Alexion Medical Monitor.</p>

    <p>A participant is considered to have completed the study if he/she has completed
    all phases of the study including the last scheduled procedure shown in the Schedule
    of Activities (SoA). The end of the study is defined as the date the last participant
    completes the last visit shown in the SoA (Section 1.3).</p>

    <p>As ALXN1840 is expected to increase copper excretion through fecal excretion,
    copper in stool will be critical for determining copper balance. Because stools
    can be irregular, assessment of copper and molybdenum balance will only include
    data up to the day of the final bowel movement. For example, for the period Day
    1 through Day 8, if the final bowel movement occurs on Day 7, average daily copper
    balance for the Day 1 through Day 8 period will only include data from Day 1 through
    Day 7.</p>

    <p>In the case of the 15 mg/day steady-state period (ie, Day 25 through Day 28),
    stool data collected on Days 29 - 30 samples may be used if needed to support
    assessments for the 15 mg/day dose. Use of these stool data (as needed) are consistent
    with an approximately 2-day gastrointestinal transit time.</p>

    <p>In the case of stool irregularity, and to support assessment of copper output
    over time, bowel movement copper and molybdenum outputs may be averaged over the
    days between bowel movement (or start of study) to ensure an approximate value
    for each 24-hour period.</p>'
